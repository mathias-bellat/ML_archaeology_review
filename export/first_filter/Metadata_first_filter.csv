"Mapping patterns of long-term settlement in Northern Mesopotamia at a large scale"	"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"	"The landscapes of the Near East show both the first settlements and the longest trajectories of settlement systems. Mounding is a characteristic property of these settlement sites, resulting from millennia of continuing settlement activity at distinguished places. So far, however, this defining feature of ancient settlements has not received much attention, or even been the subject of systematic evaluation. We propose a remote sensing approach for comprehensively mapping the pattern of human settlement at large scale and establish the largest archaeological record for a landscape in Mesopotamia, mapping about 14,000 settlement sites—spanning eight millennia—at 15-m resolution in a 23,000-km               2               area in northeastern Syria. To map both low- and high-mounded places—the latter of which are often referred to as “tells”—we develop a strategy for detecting anthrosols in time series of multispectral satellite images and measure the volume of settlement sites in a digital elevation model. Using this volume as a proxy to continued occupation, we find a dependency of the long-term attractiveness of a site on local water availability, but also a strong relation to the relevance within a basin-wide exchange network that we can infer from our record and third millennium B.C. intersite routes visible on the ground until recent times. We believe it is possible to establish a nearly comprehensive map of human settlements in the fluvial plains of northern Mesopotamia and beyond, and site volume may be a key quantity to uncover long-term trends in human settlement activity from such a record."

"Detection of Ancient Settlement Mounds"	"Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing"	"In the present study we demonstrate the value of the SRTM three arcsecond terrain model for a virtual survey of archae-ological sites: the detection and mapping of ancient settle-ment mounds in the Near East. These so-called “tells” are the result of millennia of occupation within the period from 8000–1000 BC, and form visible landmarks of the world’s first farming and urban communities. The SRTM model provides for the first time an opportunity to scan areas not yet surveyed archaeologically on a supra-regional scale and to pinpoint probable tell sites. In order to map these historic monuments for the purpose of settlement-study and conser-vation, we develop a machine learning classifier which identifies probable tell sites from the terrain model. In a test, point-like elevations of a characteristic tell shape, standing out for more than 5 to 6 m in the DEM were successfully detected (85/133 tells). False positives (327/(600*1200) pixels) were primarily due to natural elevations, resembling tells in height and size."	"MENZE_2006.txt"

One of the issues of settlement modeling is that models are typically used to explore the relationship between settlement locations and associated influential factors (e.g., slope and aspect). However, few studies in settlement modeling adopted landscape visibility analysis. Landscape visibility provides useful information for understanding human decision-making associated with the establishment of settlements. In the past years, machine learning algorithms have demonstrated their capabilities in improving the performance of the settlement modeling and particularly capturing the nonlinear relationship between settlement locations and their drivers. However, simulation models using machine learning algorithms in settlement modeling are still not well studied. Moreover, overfitting issues and optimization of model parameters are major challenges for most machine learning algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we sought to pursue two research objectives. First, we aimed to evaluate the contribution of viewsheds and landscape visibility to the simulation modeling of - settlement locations. The second objective is to examine the performance of the machine learning algorithm-based simulation models for settlement location studies. Our study region is located in the metropolitan area of Oyo Empire, Nigeria, West Africa, ca. AD 1570–1830, and its pre-Imperial antecedents, ca. AD 1360–1570. We developed an event-driven spatial simulation model enabled by random forest algorithm to represent dynamics in settlement systems in our study region. Experimental results demonstrate that viewsheds and landscape visibility may offer more insights into unveiling the underlying mechanism that drives settlement locations. Random forest algorithm, as a machine learning algorithm, provide solid support for establishing the relationship between settlement occurrences and their drivers."

This work presents an account of a metric learning-based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to an archaeological dataset. The proposed account speaks of three stages: training, testing/validating, and community detection. Several thousand artefact images, ranging from the Lower Palaeolithic period (1.4 million years ago) to the Late Islamic period (fourteenth century AD), were used to train the model (i.e., the CNN), to discern artefacts by site and period. After training, it attained a comparable accuracy to archaeologists in various periods. In order to test the model, it was called to identify new query images according to similarities with known (training) images. Validation blinding experiments showed that while archaeologists performed as well as the model within their field of expertise, they fell behind concerning other periods. Lastly, a community detection algorithm based on the confusion matrix data was used to discern affiliations across sites. A case-study on Levantine Natufian artefacts demonstrated the algorithm’s capacity to discern meaningful connections. As such, the model has the potential to reveal yet unknown patterns in archaeological data."	"Resler et al. - 2021 - A deep-learning model for predictive archaeology a.txt"

On the other hand, data mining in general and machine learning in particular have already inspired many disciplines to introduce new paradigms of data analysis and knowledge discovery. Hence, this article aims for reviving the Typological Debate by adapting approved methods from other fields of science to archaeological data. To this end, we extensively discuss the concept of similarity and assess the suitability of machine learning techniques for the purposes of classification and typology development. Our methodology covers all steps starting from unordered, unlabelled objects to the emergence of a consistent and reusable typology. The application of this process is exemplarily illustrated by classifying the vessels from a Late Bronze Age cemetery in Eastern Saxony. Despite the individual character of these vessels, we achieved class prediction rates of more than 95%. Such a success was only possible, because we permanently reconciled the output of the learning algorithms with our own expectations in order to identify and eliminate the systematic errors within the typology."

Datasheets and pictures, stratigraphic data and 3D models, time and space mixed together: these are only a few of the categories a researcher has to deal with.

In this paper, we describe the whole process for the design and development of a prototype application that uses an Immersive Virtual Reality system to acces archaeological excavation 3D data through the Gesture Variation Follower (GVF) algorithm. This makes it possible to recognise which gesture is being performed and how it is performed.

Interactive machine learning techniques have been used for the real time detection of the gestures. As a case study the agora of Segesta (Sicily, Italy) has been selected.

Paradoxically, however, spatial representation lacks the ability to convey archaeological interpretations. By example of excavations in Alken Enge, Denmark, this paper explores how a web-based 3D platform is able to facilitate the collaborative exchange of 3D excavation content and how the integration of spatial and attribute data into one common event-based data model may be advantageous. This includes enhancing the semantic value of field-recorded 3D models by segmenting the geometry using various techniques, such as 3D projections and machine learning. Accordingly, the paper demonstrates a framework for interactive 3D models, which includes attributed classification based on segmented 3D content correlated with traditional raster, vector, and textual data, delivering a spatially integrated platform for collaborative research."

Archaeological features are traditionally emphasised on a LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using multiple Visualisation Techniques (VTs), and occasionally aided by automated feature detection or classification techniques. Such an approach offers limited results when applied to heterogeneous structures (different sizes, morphologies), which is often the case for archaeological remains that have been altered throughout the ages. This study proposes to overcome these limitations by developing a multi-scale analysis of topographic position combined with supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). Rather than highlighting individual topographic anomalies, the multi-scalar approach allows archaeological features to be examined not only as individual objects, but within their broader spatial context. This innovative and straightforward method provides two levels of results: a composite image of topographic surface structure and a probability map of the presence of archaeological structures. The method was developed to detect and characterise megalithic funeral structures in the region of Carnac, the Bay of Quiberon, and the Gulf of Morbihan (France), which is currently considered for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List. As a result, known archaeological sites have successfully been geo-referenced with a greater accuracy than before (even when located under dense vegetation) and a ground-check confirmed the identification of a previously unknown Neolithic burial mound in the commune of Carnac."

For over a century, statisticians have been using classification and clustering techniques to infer patterns in data that can be defined by algorithms. In the case of archaeology, linear regression algorithms are often used to chronologically date features and sites, and pattern recognition is used to develop typologies and classifications. However, archaeological data is often expensive to collect, and analyses are often limited by poor sample sizes and datasets. Here we show that recent advances in computation allow archaeologists to use machine learning based on much of the same statistical theory to address more complex problems using increased computing power and larger and incomplete datasets. This paper approaches the problem of predicting the chronology of archaeological sites through a case study of medieval temples in Angkor, Cambodia. For this study, we have a large dataset of temples with known architectural elements and artifacts; however, less than ten percent of the sample of temples have known dates, and much of the attribute data is incomplete. Our results suggest that the algorithms can predict dates for temples from 821-1150 CE with a 49-66-year average absolute error. We find that this method surpasses traditional supervised and unsupervised statistical approaches for under-specified portions of the dataset and is a promising new method for anthropological inquiry."

Remote sensing using airborne and satellite sensors is an essential tool for rapidly investigating human traces over large surfaces of our planet, but even large monumental structures may be visible as only faint indications on the surface. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of a machine learning approach using airborne laser scanning data to address a needle-in-a-haystack problem, which involves the search for remnants of Viking ring fortresses throughout Denmark. First ring detection was applied using the Hough circle transformations and template matching, which detected 202,048 circular features in Denmark. This was reduced to 199 candidate sites by using their geometric properties and the application of machine learning techniques to classify the cultural and topographic context of the features. Two of these near perfectly circular features are convincing candidates for Viking Age fortresses, and two are candidates for either glacial landscape features or simple meteor craters. Ground-truthing revealed the latter sites as ice age features, while the cultural heritage sites BorgO and Tr ae lbanke urge renewed archaeological investigation in the light of our findings. The fact that machine learning identifies compelling new candidate sites for ring fortresses demonstrates the power of the approach. Our automatic approach is applicable worldwide where digital terrain models are available to search for cultural heritage sites, geomorphological features, and meteor impact craters."

The challenges and costs of skill learning constitute an oft-neglected factor in the evaluation of alternative adaptive strategies and a potential source of bias in cultural transmission. Similarly, theory and data indicate that the most salient neural and cognitive demands of stone tool-making should occur during learning rather than expert performance. Unfortunately, the behavioral complexity and extensive learning requirements that make stone knapping skill acquisition an interesting object of study are the very features that make it so challenging to investigate experimentally. Here we present results from a multidisciplinary study of Late Acheulean handaxe-making skill acquisition involving twenty-six naive participants and up to 90 hours training over several months, accompanied by a battery of psychometric, behavioral, and neuroimaging assessments. In this initial report, we derive a robust quantitative skill metric for the experimental handaxes using machine learning algorithms, reconstruct a group-level learning curve, and explore sources of individual variation in learning outcomes. Results identify particular cognitive targets of selection on the efficiency or reliability of tool-making skill acquisition, quantify learning costs, highlight the likely importance of social support, motivation, persistence, and self-control in knapping skill acquisition, and illustrate methods for reliably reconstructing ancient learning processes from archaeological evidence.

However, accessing datasets on the location of these species can be challenging, particularly when the current distribution no longer reflects areas with the full range of suitable growing conditions because of past logging. We test whether using occurrence data from community-based field surveys and archaeological records in species distribution models can help predict the distribution of monumental western redcedar trees (Thuja plicata)-large, high-quality trees suitable for cultural purposes such as carving dug-out canoes, totem poles and traditional houses. This species is critically important to indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest of North America, but trees suitable for traditional carving and building are diminishing in abundance due to logging. Location Our analysis covers the spatial extent of the traditional territory of the Heiltsuk First Nation, which encompasses a portion of the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, Canada. Methods We built and compared species distribution models using the machine learning program, Maxent, based on occurrence data from field surveys and archaeological records of culturally modified trees. Results Our findings highlight similarities and differences between the predictions from these species distribution models. When validating these models against occurrences from an independent dataset, the archaeological record model performs better than the field survey model. These findings may arise because the independent dataset was collected on an unlogged island-an environment that aligns more closely with the historic forest conditions revealed by the archaeological records than the current distribution revealed by the field surveys. Main conclusions We demonstrate and discuss the utility of using archaeological data in species distribution modelling and conservation planning when the target species is associated with shifting environmental baselines, data limitations and an important cultural resource."

"Drivers of Late Pleistocene human survival and dispersal: an agent-based modeling and machine learning approach"	"Quaternary Science Reviews"	"Understanding Late Pleistocene human dispersals from Africa requires understanding a multifaceted problem with factors varying in space and time, such as climate, ecology, human behavior, and population dynamics. To understand how these factors interact to affect human survival and dispersal, we have developed a realistic agent-based model that includes geographic features, climate change, and time-varying vegetation and food resources. To enhance computational efficiency, we further apply machine learning algorithms. Our approach is new in that it is designed to systematically evaluate a large-scale agent-based model, and identify its key parameters and sensitivities. Results show that parameter interactions are the major source in generating variability in human dispersal and survival/extinction scenarios. In realistic scenarios with geographical features and time-evolving climatic conditions, random fluctuations become a major source of variability in arrival times and success. Furthermore, parameter settings as different as 92% of maximum possible difference, and occupying more than 30% of parameter space can result in similar dispersal scenarios. This suggests that historical contingency (similar causes - different effects) and equifinality (different causes - similar effects) are primary constituents of human dispersal scenarios. While paleoanthropology, archaeology and paleogenetics now provide insights into patterns of human dispersals at an unprecedented level of detail, elucidating the causes underlying these patterns remains a major challenge.

The selection of formal attributes to allow effective measurement and comparison of complex shapes, though, presents a crucial challenge to systematic study. Alongside fabric composition and surface treatment, consistent linear dimensions offer helpful metrics for assessing standardized production. More difficult to measure, though, are the many finely graduated variations in shape that can reflect how these processes were implemented and the limits to large-scale serial productions like those of the ancient Mediterranean world. We offer here a new method and computational pipeline, developed using open-source libraries, to quantify morphological similarities and differences among ceramics. Grounded in point cloud comparison, our method enables comprehensive 3D characterization of geometries down to the pixel level and leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and high-speed data structures for efficiency and scalability across large assemblages. Case studies of transport amphoras from two late antique shipwrecks off the coast of southwest Turkey demonstrate the robustness of the methodology and pipeline. Together, they provide an analytically rigorous and flexible approach to quantifying formal variation within a dataset. The first results suggest strategies for controlling the capacities of these transport jars within late ancient systems of production, but the method should also prove useful in formal analysis of artifacts of other forms and contexts."

However, the un-monitored deployment of UAVs called the amateur drones (AmDr) can lead to serious security threats and risk to human life and infrastructure. Therefore, timely detection of the AmDr is essential for the protection and security of sensitive organizations, human life and other vital infrastructure. AmDrs can be detected using different techniques based on sound, video, thermal, and radio frequencies. However, the performance of these techniques is limited in sever atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we propose an efficient un-supervise machine learning approach of independent component analysis (ICA) to detect various acoustic signals i.e., sounds of bird, airplanes, thunderstorm, rain, wind and the UAVs in practical scenario. After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), the power spectral density (PSD) and the Root Mean Square Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM)and K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)to detect the presence or absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a single or multiple AmDrs at a time in the presence of multiple acoustic interfering signals. The proposed technique is verified through extensive simulations and it is observed that the RMS values of PSD with KNN performs better than the MFCC with KNN and SVM."

Several different machine learning algorithms for binary pixel classification (i.e. stone vs non-stone) were evaluated. Input features were extracted from high-resolution orthomosaics and digital elevation models (both derived from aerial imaging). Comparative analysis used two colour spaces (RGB and HSV), texture features (contrast, homogeneity and entropy raster maps), and the topographic position index, combined with nine supervised learning algorithms (nearest centroid, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, linear and quadratic discriminant analyses, support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural network). When features are processed together, excellent output maps, very close to or outperforming current standards in archaeology, are observed for almost all classifiers. The size of the training set can be drastically reduced (to ca. 300 samples) by majority voting, while maintaining performance at the highest level (about 99.5% for all performance scores). Note, however, that if the training set is inadequate or not fully representative, the classification results are poor. That said, the methods applied and tested here are extremely rapid. Extensive mapping, which would have been difficult with traditional, manual, or semiautomatic delineation of stones using a vector graphics editor, now becomes possible. This workflow generally surpasses pedestrian surveys using differential GPS or a total station. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."

"Automated detection of archaeological mounds using machine-learning classification of multisensor and multitemporal satellite data"	"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"	"This paper presents an innovative multisensor, multitemporal machine-learning approach using remote sensing big data for the detection of archaeological mounds in Cholistan (Pakistan). The Cholistan Desert presents one of the largest concentrations of Indus Civilization sites (from ca. 3300 to 1500 BC). Cholistan has figured prominently in theories about changes in water availability, the rise and decline of the Indus Civilization, and the transformation of fertile monsoonal alluvial plains into an extremely arid margin. This paper implements a multisensor, multitemporal machine-learning approach for the remote detection of archaeological mounds. A classifier algorithm that employs a large-scale collection of synthetic-aperture radar and multispectral images has been implemented in Google Earth Engine, resulting in an accurate probability map for mound-like signatures across an area that covers ca. 36,000 km(2). The results show that the area presents many more archaeological mounds than previously recorded, extending south and east into the desert, which has major implications for understanding the archaeological significance of the region. The detection of small (<5 ha) to large mounds (>30 ha) suggests that there were continuous shifts in settlement location. These shifts are likely to reflect responses to a dynamic and changing hydrological network and the influence of the progressive northward advance of the desert in a long-term process that culminated in the abandonment of much of the settled area during the Late Harappan period."

"Implications for paleomobility studies of the effects of quaternary volcanism on bioavailable strontium: A test case in North Patagonia (Argentina)"	"Journal of Archaeological Science"	"Strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86) are used as geochemical tracers for paleomobility studies because they display predictable and stable patterns in ecosystems primarily controlled by the underlying geological regimes. While bedrock geology is stable over thousands of years, geomorphological processes can influence the Sr-87/Sr-86 in ecosystems over archeologically relevant timescales. Among these geomorphological processes, the deposition and reworking of volcanic sediments over Quaternary timescales are little studied but could be an important control of Sr-87/Sr-86 variations in many archeological regions. North Patagonia is a key archeological region to address animal and human movements, and an ideal location to test the influence of Quaternary volcanism on Sr-87/Sr-86 variation as it is located downwind of major volcanic centers. In this study, we aim to assess the main environmental and geological controls of bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 and to build a high-resolution isoscape using a machine learning regression framework for forthcoming paleomobility studies. We sampled several locations and analyzed different types of samples (N = 94). The ratios show a limited range of variation, which is not related to the bedrock geology. Rather, bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 variations display a progressive increase going eastward (away from the Andes), following dust aerosol deposition and elevation variations (R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 0.00041). We argue that this trend relates to the deposition and reworking of unradiogenic volcanic sediments by aeolian, fluvial and glacial erosion during the Quaternary. As most of this sediment reworking occurred during glacial periods, the current bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 variations across the study area likely represent a long-term average that varied little during the Holocene. Consequently, our isoscape provides a solid base for Holocene paleomobility studies in North Patagonia and underlines the importance of Quaternary volcanism processes for interpreting Sr-87/Sr-86 data in paleomobility studies in volcanic regions."

Web Mapping Services, such as Microsoft Bing Maps, provide imagery covering extensive areas at high resolution. These can, in some cases, reveal cropmarks of buried historical structures. Given that archaeological prospection is not generally the priority of most common Web Mapping Services, the conditions under which images are acquired are not always suitable for the appearance of cropmarks. Therefore, their detection is typically serendipitous. This pilot project attempts to assess the potential to use the Microsoft Bing Maps Bird's Eye service within a crowdsourcing platform to systematically search for archaeological cropmarks in the surroundings of the city of Rome in Italy. On this platform, which is hosted by the company Scifabric (Southampton, UK) and based on PyBossa, an Open Source framework for crowdsourcing, members of the public are invited to interpret oblique air photo tiles of Bing Maps Bird's Eye. While the project is still on-going, at least one seamless coverage of tiles in the area of interest has been interpreted. For each tile, the Bing Maps Bird's Eye service provides oblique air photo coverage in up to four possible orientations. As of 5 July 2020, 18,765 of the total 67,014 tasks have been completed. Amongst these completed tasks, positive detections of cropmarks were recorded once for 1447 tasks, twice for 57 tasks, and three or more times for 10 tasks. While many of these detections may be erroneous, some correspond with archaeological cropmarks of buried remains of buildings, roads, aqueducts, and urban areas from the Roman period, as verified by comparison with archaeological survey data. This leads to the conclusion that the Bing Maps Bird's Eye service contains a wealth of information useful for archaeological prospection, and that to a certain extent citizen researchers could help to mine this information. However, a more thorough analysis would need to be carried out on possible false negatives and biases related to the varying ease of interpretation of residues of different archaeological structures from multiple historical periods. This activity forms the first part of a research project on the systematic prospection of archaeological cropmarks. The ultimate aim is to reach a critical mass of training data through crowdsourcing which can be augmented and used as input to train a machine learning algorithm for automatic detection on a larger scale."

"Advancing predictive modeling in archaeology: An evaluation of regression and machine learning methods on the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument"	"Plos One"	"Predictive models are central to both archaeological research and cultural resource management. Yet, archaeological applications of predictive models are often insufficient due to small training data sets, inadequate statistical techniques, and a lack of theoretical insight to explain the responses of past land use to predictor variables. Here we address these critiques and evaluate the predictive power of four statistical approaches widely used in ecological modeling-generalized linear models, generalized additive models, maximum entropy, and random forests-to predict the locations of Formative Period (2100-650 BP) archaeological sites in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. We assess each modeling approach using a threshold-independent measure, the area under the curve (AUC), and threshold-dependent measures, like the true skill statistic. We find that the majority of the modeling approaches struggle with archaeological datasets due to the frequent lack of true-absence locations, which violates model assumptions of generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and random forests, as well as measures of their predictive power (AUC). Maximum entropy is the only method tested here which is capable of utilizing pseudo-absence points (inferred absence data based on known presence data) and controlling for a non-representative sampling of the landscape, thus making maximum entropy the best modeling approach for common archaeological data when the goal is prediction. Regression-based approaches may be more applicable when prediction is not the goal, given their grounding in well-established statistical theory. Random forests, while the most powerful, is not applicable to archaeological data except in the rare case where true-absence data exist. Our results have significant implications for the application of predictive models by archaeologists for research and conservation purposes and highlight the importance of understanding model assumptions."

Labeling this type of archaeological data is a tedious process. We used a data set from Pacunam LiDAR Initiative survey of lowland Maya region in Guatemala. The data set contains ancient Maya structures that were manually labeled, and ground verified to a large extent. We have built and compared two deep learning-based models, U-Net and Mask R-CNN, for semantic segmentation. The segmentation models were used in two tasks: identification of areas of ancient construction activity, and identification of the remnants of ancient Maya buildings. The U-Net based model performed better in both tasks and was capable of correctly identifying 60-66% of all objects, and 74-81% of medium sized objects. The quality of the resulting prediction was evaluated using a variety of quantifiers. Furthermore, we discuss the problems of re-purposing the archaeological style labeling for production of valid machine learning training sets. Ultimately, we outline the value of these models for archaeological research and present the road map to produce a useful decision support system for recognition of ancient objects in LiDAR data."

This region hosts critical developments in hominin and human evolution, the dispersal of food-producing populations across the continent, and some of the largest known contemporary mammalian migrations on the planet. Strontium isotope analysis of biominerals such as tooth enamel, eggshell, and other tissues in modern animals have been used to reconstruct migration, residential mobility, and provenience. The diverse geologies of Kenya and Tanzania, ranging from the Archaean Basement System rocks of the Tanzania Craton to the recent volcanics of rift valleys, make it a highly promising area for mobility and provenience studies using strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86). Nevertheless, the application of strontium isotope analysis to reconstruct migration and individual mobility has been limited in the region due to the lack of a map predicting biologically available (bioavailable) Sr-87/Sr-86. We present bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 data from a variety of modern and archaeological materials throughout Kenya and northern Tanzania. We show that Sr-87/Sr-86 of living organisms in the study area range from as low as 0.70439 for samples collected from Neogene volcanics to 0.72796 for samples collected from Precambrian Basement System rocks. We also present an Sr-87/Sr-86 map (isoscape) of Kenya and Tanzania developed using a machine-learning framework and a compilation of bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 data from Africa. This map provides the first predictions of bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 for East Africa, and represents a crucial resource for future work on ancient and modern animal and human mobility."

Nevertheless, it has never been used for the stratigraphic study of historical buildings. Thus far, archaeologists and architects, the experts in archaeology of architecture, have led this research. The method consisted of visually-and, consequently, subjectively-identifying certain evidence regarding the elevations of such buildings that could be a consequence of the passage of time. In this article, we would like to present the results from one of the research projects pursued by our group, in which we automated the stratigraphic study of some historic buildings using multivariate statistic techniques. To this end, we first measured the building using surveying techniques to create a 3D model, and then, we broke down every stone into qualitative and quantitative variables. To identify the stratigraphic features on the walls, we applied machine learning by conducting different predictive and descriptive analyses. The predictive analyses were used to rule out any blocks of stone with different characteristics, such as rough stones, joint ashlars, and voussoirs of arches; these are irregularities that probably show building processes and whose identification is crucial in ascertaining the structural evolution of the building. In supervised learning, we experimented with decision trees and random forest- and although the results were good in all cases, we ultimately opted to implement the predictive model obtained using the last one. While identifying the evidence on the walls, it was also very important to identify different continuity solutions or interfaces present on them, because although these are elements without materiality, they are of great value in terms of timescale, because they delimit different strata and allow us to deduce the relationship between them."

Variable selection for model training was carried out by using best subset selection, which evaluates all possible combinations of variables. Evaluation of the model was performed by computing common machine learning statistics along with estimated percentage error. Results make it possible to determine the best variables and estimate their relationships with flake mass.

The pigments used in prehistoric paintings present high light sensitivity and rigorous scientific color degradation mapping is not usually undertaken in overall archaeological sites. Microfading spectrometry is a suitable technique for determining the light-stability of pigments found in rock art paintings in a non-destructive way. Spectral data can be transformed into colorimetric information following the recommendations published by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage(CIE). The fading degree can be evaluated through the color changes produced, computing both color and chromatic differences. Microfading Tester (MFT) measurements on spot samples are time-consuming and difficult to materialize on-site. This paper presents the results of statistical Gaussian process interpolation to map the potential MFT spectral variations overtime on a scene full of prehistoric rock art paintings. In addition, a descriptive analysis of color variations that may suffer the rock art motifs overtime has been carried out. The advanced statistical methodology implemented can highlight potential changes on some rock support areas, and stable conditions on the painted red motifs over time, which can help to establish future conservation actions in the archaeological site.

However, the sheer amount of traces and of available high-quality data necessitates the use of computational methods for the automatic detection of these archaeological objects. Therefore, a novel approach, named CarcassonNet, has been developed that uses a combination of a Deep Learning convolutional neural network and image processing algorithms to detect and trace hollow roads in LiDAR data from the Netherlands. CarcassonNet has been specifically developed for the archaeological domain, focusing on being computationally light and suited for reconstructing partially preserved and intersected hollow roads. Instead of using the whole roads as input for the convolutional neural network, in CarcassonNet individual sections are used. This makes it much more cost-effective to create a sufficient training dataset, and makes the classification task (performed by the neural network) relatively simple, with better detection results. The output of CarcassonNet consists of two types of geospatial vectors that offer the opportunity to efficiently study the roads themselves and their precise location in the landscape (polygons), and the course of the roads and the resulting route network (lines). An experimental evaluation shows that CarcassonNet is able to effectively detect hollow roads, with a MCC score of 0.47. Furthermore, it is shown that using the Digital Terrain Model, instead of visualized LiDAR data (hillshade) improves the performance of the convolutional neural network. The results of this research offer opportunities to reconstruct vanished and abandoned (post)medieval routes and answer questions about human-landscape interactions. (C) 2020 L'Auteur(s).

In this work we employ the first ever machine learning analysis of Australian rock art using a data efficient transfer learning approach to identify features suitable for distinguishing styles of rock art. These features are evaluated in a one-shot learning setting. Results demonstrate that known Arnhem Land Rock art styles can be resolved without knowledge of prior groupings. We then analyse the activation space of learned features and report on the relationships between styles and arrange these classes into a stylistic chronology based on distance within the activation space. By generating a stylistic chronology, it is shown that the model is sensitive to both temporal and spatial patterns in the distribution of rock art in the Arnhem Land Plateau region. More broadly, this approach is ideally suited to evaluating style within any material culture assemblage and overcomes the common constraint of small training data sets in archaeological machine learning studies."

The ArchAIDE project realised an AI-based application to recognise archaeological pottery. Pottery is of paramount importance for understanding archaeological contexts. However, recognition of ceramics is still a manual, time-consuming activity, reliant on analogue catalogues. The project developed two complementary machine-learning tools to propose identifications based on images captured on-site, for optimising and economising this process, while retaining key decision points necessary to create trusted results. One method relies on the shape of a potsherd; the other is based on decorative features. For the shape-based recognition, a novel deep-learning architecture was employed, integrating shape information from points along the inner and outer profile of a sherd. The decoration classifier is based on relatively standard architectures used in image recognition. In both cases, training the algorithms meant facing challenges related to real-world archaeological data: the scarcity of labelled data; extreme imbalance between instances of different categories; and the need to take note of minute differentiating features. Finally, the creation of a desktop and mobile application that integrates the AI classifiers provides an easy-to-use interface for pottery classification and storing pottery data."

Among these, pottery vessels are significantly useful, given their relative abundance in most archaeological sites. However, this very abundance makes difficult and complex an accurate representation, since no two of these vessels are identical, and therefore classification criteria must be justified and applied. For this purpose, we propose the use of deep learning architectures to extract automatically learned features without prior knowledge or engineered features. By means of transfer learning, we retrained a Residual Neural Network with a binary image database of Iberian wheel-made pottery vessels' profiles. These vessels pertain to archaeological sites located in the upper valley of the Guadalquivir River (Spain). The resulting model can provide an accurate feature representation space, which can automatically classify profile images, achieving a mean accuracy of 0.96 with an f -measure of 0.96. This accuracy is remarkably higher than other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, where several feature extraction techniques were applied together with multiple classifier models.

This tradition was particularly strong during the Nordic Bronze Age (1700-550 BC) in southern Scandinavia with over 20,000 boats and thousands of humans, animals, wagons, etc. This vivid and highly engaging material provides quantitative data of high potential to understand Bronze Age social structures and ideologies. The ability to provide the technically best possible documentation and to automate identification and classification of images would help to take full advantage of the research potential of petroglyphs in southern Scandinavia and elsewhere. We, therefore, attempted to train a model that locates and classifies image objects using faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster-RCNN) based on data produced by a novel method to improve visualizing the content of 3D documentations. A newly created layer of 3D rock art documentation provides the best data currently available and has reduced inscribed bias compared to older methods. Several models were trained based on input images annotated with bounding boxes produced with different parameters to find the best solution. The data included 4305 individual images in 408 scans of rock art sites. To enhance the models and enrich the training data, we used data augmentation and transfer learning. The successful models perform exceptionally well on boats and circles, as well as with human figures and wheels. This work was an interdisciplinary undertaking which led to important reflections about archaeology, digital humanities, and artificial intelligence.

Provenancing biological materials using strontium isotope ratios requires a map of bioavailable strontium, commonly known as an isoscape, to compare results with. Both producing the isoscape and using it to interpret results present methodological challenges that researchers must carefully consider. A review of current research indicates that, while many archives can be analyzed to produce isoscapes, modern plant materials usually provide the best approximation of bioavailable strontium and can be used alone or combined with other archives if applying machine learning. Domain mapping currently produces the most accurate, most interpretable isoscapes for most research questions; however, machine learning approaches promise to provide more accurate and geographically wide-ranging isoscapes over time. Using strontium isotope analysis for provenancing is most successful when combined with other isotopes and/or trace elements as part of a likelihood approach. Strontium isoscapes that are both appropriate and sufficiently high resolution to answer specific research questions do not exist for most parts of the world. Researchers intending to incorporate strontium analysis into their research designs should expect to conduct primary sampling and analysis to create appropriate isoscapes or refine existing ones, which should themselves not be uncritically utilized. When sampling, it is essential to collect appropriate metadata; these metadata and the results of the analyses should be archived in one of several online databases to maximize their usefulness. With increasing amounts of primary data and the likely increased availability of machine learning approaches to mapping, strontium analysis will continue to improve as a method of provenancing."

Small datasets associated with archaeological work make ML vulnerable to hidden complexity, systemic bias, and high validation costs if not managed appropriately. ML's scalability, flexibility, and rapid development, however, make it an essential part of twenty-first-century archaeological practice. This review briefly describes what ML is, how it is being used in archaeology today, and where it might be used in the future for archaeological purposes."	"aap.2021.6.txt"

This work is intended to apply a new methodology to the field of underwater archaeology. Shipwrecks represent a major resource to understand maritime human activity over millennia, but underwater archaeology is expensive, misappropriated, and hazardous. An automated tool to rapidly detect and map shipwrecks can therefore be used to create more accurate maps of natural and archaeological features to aid management objectives, study patterns across the landscape, and find new features. Additionally, more comprehensive and accurate shipwreck maps can help to prioritize site selection and plan excavation. The model is based on open source topo-bathymetric data and shipwreck data for the United States available from NOAA. The model uses transfer learning to compensate for a relatively small sample size and addresses a recurring problem that associated work has had with false positives by training the model both on shipwrecks and background topography. Results of statistical analyses conducted-ANOVAs and box and whisker plots-indicate that there are substantial differences between the morphologic characteristics that define shipwrecks vs. background topography, supporting this approach to addressing false positives. The model uses a YOLOv3 architecture and produced an F1 score of 0.92 and a precision score of 0.90, indicating that the approach taken herein to address false positives was successful."

However, the lack of maps predicting sulfur isotope variations on the landscape limits the possibility to use this isotopic system in quantitative geographic assignments. We compiled a database of 2,680 sulfur isotope analyses in the collagen of archaeological human and animal teeth from 221 individual locations across Western Europe. We used this isotopic compilation and remote sensing data to apply a multivariate machine-learning regression, and to predict sulfur isotope variations across Western Europe. The resulting model shows that sulfur isotope patterns are highly predictable, with 65% of sulfur isotope variations explained using only 4 variables representing marine sulfate deposition and local geological conditions. We used this novel sulfur isoscape and existing strontium and oxygen isoscapes of Western Europe to apply triple isotopes continuous-surface probabilistic geographic assignments to assess the origin of a series of teeth from local animals and humans from Brittany. We accurately and precisely constrained the origin of these individuals to limited regions of Brittany. This approach is broadly transferable to studies in archaeology and paleoecology as illustrated in a companion paper (Colleter et al. 2021)."

"Predicting wildfire impacts on the prehistoric archaeological record of the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico, USA"	"Fire Ecology"	"Background Wildfires of uncharacteristic severity, a consequence of climate changes and accumulated fuels, can cause amplified or novel impacts to archaeological resources. The archaeological record includes physical features associated with human activity; these exist within ecological landscapes and provide a unique long-term perspective on human-environment interactions. The potential for fire-caused damage to archaeological materials is of major concern because these resources are irreplaceable and non-renewable, have social or religious significance for living peoples, and are protected by an extensive body of legislation. Although previous studies have modeled ecological burn severity as a function of environmental setting and climate, the fidelity of these variables as predictors of archaeological fire effects has not been evaluated. This study, focused on prehistoric archaeological sites in a fire-prone and archaeologically rich landscape in the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico, USA, identified the environmental and climate variables that best predict observed fire severity and fire effects to archaeological features and artifacts. Results Machine learning models (Random Forest) indicate that topography and variables related to pre-fire weather and fuel condition are important predictors of fire effects and severity at archaeological sites. Fire effects were more likely to be present when fire-season weather was warmer and drier than average and within sites located in sloped, treed settings. Topographic predictors were highly important for distinguishing unburned, moderate, and high site burn severity as classified in post-fire archaeological assessments. High-severity impacts were more likely at archaeological sites with southern orientation or on warmer, steeper, slopes with less accumulated surface moisture, likely associated with lower fuel moistures and high potential for spreading fire. Conclusions Models for predicting where and when fires may negatively affect the archaeological record can be used to prioritize fuel treatments, inform fire management plans, and guide post-fire rehabilitation efforts, thus aiding in cultural resource preservation."

In this article, we propose a method for matching and assembling pairs of ancient papyrus fragments containing mostly unknown scriptures. Papyrus paper is manufactured from papyrus plants and therefore portrays typical thread patterns resulting from the plant's stems. The proposed algorithm is founded on the hypothesis that these thread patterns contain unique local attributes such that nearby fragments show similar patterns reflecting the continuations of the threads. We posit that these patterns can be exploited using image processing and machine learning techniques to identify matching fragments. The algorithm and system which we present support the quick and automated classification of matching pairs of papyrus fragments as well as the geometric alignment of the pairs against each other. The algorithm consists of a series of steps and is based on deep-learning and machine learning methods. The first step is to deconstruct the problem of matching fragments into a smaller problem of finding thread continuation matches in local edge areas (squares) between pairs of fragments. This phase is solved using a convolutional neural network ingesting raw images of the edge areas and producing local matching scores. The result of this stage yields very high recall but low precision. Thus, we utilize these scores in order to conclude about the matching of entire fragments pairs by establishing an elaborate voting mechanism. We enhance this voting with geometric alignment techniques from which we extract additional spatial information. Eventually, we feed all the data collected from these steps into a Random Forest classifier in order to produce a higher order classifier capable of predicting whether a pair of fragments is a match. Our algorithm was trained on a batch of fragments which was excavated from the Dead Sea caves and is dated circa the 1st century BCE. The algorithm shows excellent results on a validation set which is of a similar origin and conditions. We then tried to run the algorithm against a real-life set of fragments for which we have no prior knowledge or labeling of matches. This test batch is considered extremely challenging due to its poor condition and the small size of its fragments. Evidently, numerous researchers have tried seeking matches within this batch with very little success. Our algorithm performance on this batch was sub-optimal, returning a relatively large ratio of false positives. However, the algorithm was quite useful by eliminating 98% of the possiblematches thus reducing the amount of work needed formanual inspection. Indeed, experts that reviewed the results have identified some positive matches as potentially true and referred them for further investigation."

The so-called scan-to-BIM process can, in fact, benefit from such data, and they can themselves be a source for further analyses or activities on the archaeological and built heritage. There are several ways to exploit this type of data, such as Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM), mesh creation, rasterisation, classification, and semantic segmentation. The latter, referring to point clouds, is a trending topic not only in the CH domain but also in other fields like autonomous navigation, medicine or retail. Precisely in these sectors, the task of semantic segmentation has been mainly exploited and developed with artificial intelligence techniques. In particular, machine learning (ML) algorithms, and their deep learning (DL) subset, are increasingly applied and have established a solid state-of-the-art in the last half-decade. However, applications of DL techniques on heritage point clouds are still scarce; therefore, we propose to tackle this framework within the built heritage field. Starting from some previous tests with the Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN), in this research close attention is paid to: i) the investigation of fine-tuned models, used as a transfer learning technique, ii) the combination of external classifiers, such as Random Forest (RF), with the artificial neural network, and iii) data augmentation results evaluation for the domain-specific ArCH dataset. Finally, after analysing the main advantages and critical aspects, a proposal is made evaluating the extent to which this methodology can also be useful for non-programming or domain experts."

Mapping the piles of such sites is an indispensable basis to the exploitation of the high resolution absolute chronological data gained through dendrochronology. In a case study at the underwater site of Plo.ca, Mi.cov Grad at Lake Ohrid, North Macedonia, nine consecutive 10 m(2) strips and a 6 m(2) excavation section were uncovered, the situation documented, and the wood piles sampled. The gained data was vectorized in a geographic information system. During two field campaigns, a total of 794 wooden elements on a surface of 96 m(2) could be documented three-dimensionally with a residual error of less than 2 cm. The exceptionally high number of fishes in the 5 m deep water resulted in a significant covering of potentially important information on the relevant photos. We present a machine learning approach, especially developed and successfully applied to the automatic detection and masking of these fishes in order to eliminate them from the images. The discussed documentation workflow enables an efficient, cost-effective, accurate and reproducible mapping of pile fields.

Despite promising results in the detection phase, there is still a lack of a standard set of measures to evaluate the performance of object detection methods, since buried archaeological sites often have distinctive shapes that set them aside from other types of objects included in mainstream remote sensing datasets (e.g., Dataset of Object deTection in Aerial images, DOTA). Additionally, archaeological research relies heavily on geospatial information when validating the output of an object detection procedure, a type of information that is not normally considered in regular machine learning validation pipelines. This paper tackles these shortcomings by introducing two novel automatic evaluation measures, namely 'centroid-based' and 'pixel-based', designed to encode the salient aspects of the archaeologists' thinking process. To test their usability, an experiment with different object detection deep neural networks was conducted on a LiDAR dataset. The experimental results show that these two automatic measures closely resemble the semi-automatic one currently used by archaeologists and therefore can be adopted as fully automatic evaluation measures in archaeological remote sensing detection. Adoption will facilitate cross-study comparisons and close collaboration between machine learning and archaeological researchers, which in turn will encourage the development of novel human-centred archaeological object detection tools."

The results of such a process are used in archaeology for analyzing the origin and manufacturing techniques of ancient ceramics. In this paper we present a methodology for the segmentation and analysis of thin sections of material segments and reaching some conclusions in a fully automatic way. We employ machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze a video of the thin section sample, acquired under an optical microscope. When examined under polarized light, the color of segments may vary during sample rotation. This variation is due to the optical properties of the materials and it provides valuable information about the material inclusions in the sample. Using the video as our input, we perform an entire-video segmentation. To accomplish this task, we developed a hierarchical categorical mean-shift-based algorithm. Using the entire-video segmentation we examine the detected segments and gather statistical information about their sizes, shapes and colors and present an overall report about the sample. We tested the algorithm on nine specimens of ancient ceramics, taken from three different Mediterranean sites.

We evaluate past uses of radar, multispectral, and LiDAR datasets in Northwest Belize across well-studied wetland field complexes that occur under different vegetation conditions. Next, we compare topographic products derived from LiDAR data commonly used for archaeology and geomorphology. Lastly, we train a machine learning algorithm to detect ancient canals with LiDAR data and test the algorithm on a newly rediscovered field system. The spatial resolution of any dataset must be sufficiently high (2-m or finer resolution) to detect most of these canals reliably. High resolution multispectral sensors can detect canals in open areas, but most wetland complexes are under dense tropical forest impenetrable to multispectral instruments. LiDAR data were the most useful due to the high spatial resolution (0.5-m) and the ability to penetrate canopy, but still have limitations under certain conditions. The intensity of the LiDAR returns with multispectral LiDAR systems can reveal differences in soil and vegetation between ancient canals and fields in places leveled by modern farmers. The algorithm successfully maps ancient canals but has many false positives in natural depressions and drainages. Although the machine learning approach tested here cannot be used on its own, we used it with the LiDAR visualizations to refine the canal estimates from previous studies, mapping nearly 50% more canals in the Central Rio Bravo floodplain than originally published."

However, recent technological advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular deep learning methods, open possibilities for the automated analysis of large areas of remote sensing data. This paper examines the applicability and potential of supervised deep learning methods for the detection and mapping of different kinds of archaeological sites comprising features such as walls and linear or curvilinear structures of different dimensions, spectral and geometrical properties. Our work deliberately uses open-source imagery to demonstrate the accessibility of these tools. One of the main challenges facing AI approaches has been that they require large amounts of labeled data to achieve high levels of accuracy so that the training stage requires significant computational resources. Our results show, however, that even with relatively limited amounts of data, simple eight-layer, fully convolutional network can be trained efficiently using minimal computational resources, to identify and classify archaeological sites and successfully distinguish them from features with similar characteristics. By increasing the number of training sets and switching to the use of high-performance computing the accuracy of the identified areas increases.

"Frontiers in artificial intelligence"	"Through the use of examples, we explain one way in which applied topology has evolved since the birth of persistent homology in the early 2000s. The first  applications of topology to data emphasized the global shape of a dataset, such  as the three-circle model for 3 × 3 pixel patches from natural images, or the  configuration space of the cyclo-octane molecule, which is a sphere with a Klein  bottle attached via two circles of singularity. In these studies of global shape,  short persistent homology bars are disregarded as sampling noise. More recently,  however, persistent homology has been used to address questions about the local  geometry of data. For instance, how can local geometry be vectorized for use in  machine learning problems? Persistent homology and its vectorization methods,  including persistence landscapes and persistence images, provide popular  techniques for incorporating both local geometry and global topology into machine  learning. Our meta-hypothesis is that the short bars are as important as the long  bars for many machine learning tasks. In defense of this claim, we survey  applications of persistent homology to shape recognition, agent-based modeling,  materials science, archaeology, and biology. Additionally, we survey work  connecting persistent homology to geometric features of spaces, including  curvature and fractal dimension, and various methods that have been used to  incorporate persistent homology into machine learning."

"Scientific reports"	"It is 50 years since Sieveking et al. published their pioneering research in Nature on the geochemical analysis of artefacts from Neolithic flint mines in  southern Britain. In the decades since, geochemical techniques to source stone  artefacts have flourished globally, with a renaissance in recent years from new  instrumentation, data analysis, and machine learning techniques. Despite the  interest over these latter approaches, there has been variation in the quality  with which these methods have been applied. Using the case study of flint  artefacts and geological samples from England, we present a robust and objective  evaluation of three popular techniques, Random Forest, K-Nearest-Neighbour, and  Support Vector Machines, and present a pipeline for their appropriate use. When  evaluated correctly, the results establish high model classification performance,  with Random Forest leading with an average accuracy of 85% (measured through F1  Scores), and with Support Vector Machines following closely. The methodology  developed in this paper demonstrates the potential to significantly improve on  previous approaches, particularly in removing bias, and providing greater means  of evaluation than previously utilised."

"PloS one"	"The interpretation of archaeological features often requires a combined methodological approach in order to make the most of the material record,  particularly from sites where this may be limited. In practice, this requires the  consultation of different sources of information in order to cross validate  findings and combat issues of ambiguity and equifinality. However, the  application of a multiproxy approach often generates incompatible data, and might  therefore still provide ambiguous results. This paper explores the potential of a  simple digital framework to increase the explanatory power of multiproxy data by  enabling the incorporation of incompatible, ambiguous datasets in a single model.  In order to achieve this, Bayesian confirmation was used in combination with  decision trees. The results of phytolith and geochemical analyses carried out on  soil samples from ephemeral sites in Jordan are used here as a case study. The  combination of the two datasets as part of a single model enabled us to refine  the initial interpretation of the use of space at the archaeological sites by  providing an alternative identification for certain activity areas. The potential  applications of this model are much broader, as it can also help researchers in  other domains reach an integrated interpretation of analysis results by combining  different datasets."

"Learning from Scarce Information: Using Synthetic Data to Classify Roman Fine Ware Pottery."	"Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)"	"In this article, we consider a version of the challenging problem of learning from datasets whose size is too limited to allow generalisation beyond the  training set. To address the challenge, we propose to use a transfer learning  approach whereby the model is first trained on a synthetic dataset replicating  features of the original objects. In this study, the objects were smartphone  photographs of near-complete Roman terra sigillata pottery vessels from the  collection of the Museum of London. Taking the replicated features from published  profile drawings of pottery forms allowed the integration of expert knowledge  into the process through our synthetic data generator. After this first initial  training the model was fine-tuned with data from photographs of real vessels. We  show, through exhaustive experiments across several popular deep learning  architectures, different test priors, and considering the impact of the  photograph viewpoint and excessive damage to the vessels, that the proposed  hybrid approach enables the creation of classifiers with appropriate  generalisation performance. This performance is significantly better than that of  classifiers trained exclusively on the original data, which shows the promise of  the approach to alleviate the fundamental issue of learning from small datasets."

"Scientific reports"	"Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) currently includes thousands of cultivars. Discrimination between these varieties, historically done by ampelography, is  done in recent decades mostly by genetic analysis. However, when aiming to  identify archaeobotanical remains, which are mostly charred with extremely low  genomic preservation, the application of the genomic approach is rarely  successful. As a result, variety-level identification of most grape remains is  currently prevented. Because grape pips are highly polymorphic, several attempts  were made to utilize their morphological diversity as a classification tool,  mostly using 2D image analysis technics. Here, we present a highly accurate  varietal classification tool using an innovative and accessible 3D seed scanning  approach. The suggested classification methodology is machine-learning-based,  applied with the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm and the  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique. This methodology achieved  classification results of 91% to 93% accuracy in average when trained by fresh or  charred seeds to test fresh or charred seeds, respectively.

"PloS one"	"Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) are gaining considerable interest as a geolocation tool and are now widely applied in archaeology, ecology, and forensic  research. However, their application for provenance requires the development of  baseline models predicting surficial 87Sr/86Sr variations (\isoscapes\\"). A  variety of empirically-based and process-based models have been proposed to build  terrestrial 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes but, in their current forms, those models are not  mature enough to be integrated with continuous-probability surface models used in  geographic assignment. In this study, we aim to overcome those limitations and to  predict 87Sr/86Sr variations across Western Europe by combining process-based  models and a series of remote-sensing geospatial products into a regression  framework. We find that random forest regression significantly outperforms other  commonly used regression and interpolation methods, and efficiently predicts the  multi-scale patterning of 87Sr/86Sr variations by accounting for geological,  geomorphological and atmospheric controls. Random forest regression also provides  an easily interpretable and flexible framework to integrate different types of  environmental auxiliary variables required to model the multi-scale patterning of  87Sr/86Sr variability. The method is transferable to different scales and  resolutions and can be applied to the large collection of geospatial data  available at local and global levels. The isoscape generated in this study  provides the most accurate 87Sr/86Sr predictions in bioavailable strontium for  Western Europe (R2 = 0.58 and RMSE = 0.0023) to date, as well as a conservative  estimate of spatial uncertainty by applying quantile regression forest. We  anticipate that the method presented in this study combined with the growing  numbers of bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data and satellite geospatial products will  extend the applicability of the 87Sr/86Sr geo-profiling tool in provenance  applications.\""	"Bataille et al. - 2018 - A bioavailable strontium isoscape for Western Euro.txt"

A set of 15 standard femoral measurements was acquired in a training  sample (100 females; 100 males) from the Coimbra Identified Skeletal Collection  (University of Coimbra, Portugal) and models for sex classification were produced  with logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector  machines (SVM), and reduce error pruning trees (REPTree). Under cross-validation,  univariable sectioning points generated with REPTree correctly estimated sex in  60.0-87.5% of cases (systematic error ranging from 0.0 to 37.0%), while  multivariable models correctly classified sex in 84.0-92.5% of cases (bias from  0.0 to 7.0%).

Exemplarily, this is carried out using a database of 1365 Neolithic sites in the  Weiße Elster river catchment in Central Germany located between the southernmost  part of the Northern German Plain and the Central Uplands. The recorded sites are  systematically pre-processed with regard to their chronology, functional  interpretation and spatial delineation. The quality of the dataset is reviewed by  analyzing site distributions with respect to field surveys and modern land use.  The Random Forests machine learning algorithm is used to examine the impact of  terrain covariates on the depth of sites and pottery preservation. Neolithic  settlement dynamics are studied using Site Exploitation Territories, and site  frequencies per century are used to compare the intensity of land use with  adjacent landscapes. The results show that the main trends of the Neolithic  settlement dynamics can be derived from the dataset. However, Random Forests  analyses indicate poor pottery preservation in the Central Uplands and a  superimposition of Neolithic sites in the southernmost part of the Northern  German Plain. Throughout the Neolithic the margins between soils on loess and the  Weiße Elster floodplain were continuously settled, whereas only Early and Late  Neolithic land use also extended into the Central Uplands. These settlement  patterns are reflected in the results of the Site Exploitation Territories  analyses and explained with environmental economic factors.

"Scientific reports"	"Multi-scale contextual modelling is an important toolset for environmental mapping. It accounts for spatial dependence by using covariates on multiple  spatial scales and incorporates spatial context and structural dependence to  environmental properties into machine learning models. For spatial soil  modelling, three relevant scales or ranges of scale exist: quasi-local soil  formation processes that are independent of the spatial context, short-range  catenary processes, and long-range processes related to climate and large-scale  terrain settings. Recent studies investigated the spatial dependence of topsoil  properties only. We hypothesize that soil properties within a soil profile were  formed due to specific interactions between different features and scales of the  spatial context, and that there are depth gradients in spatial and structural  dependencies. The results showed that for topsoil, features at small to  intermediate scales do not increase model accuracy, whereas large scales increase  model accuracy. In contrast, subsoil models benefit from all scales-small,  intermediate, and large. Based on the differences in relevance, we conclude that  the relevant ranges of scales do not only differ in the horizontal domain, but  also in the vertical domain across the soil profile. This clearly demonstrates  the impact of contextual spatial modelling on 3D soil mapping."	"Rentschler et al. - 2022 - Contextual spatial modelling in the horizontal and.txt"

Experimental peptide tandem mass spectra are  compared to simplified models of theoretical spectra calculated from the  translated genomic sequences.

The proposed method was developed  and evaluated using 389 femurs, 412 tibias, and 404 humeri of adult individuals  from a modern Greek reference sample, the Athens Collection. The skeletal  properties, which were extracted with the CSG-Toolkit, were analyzed with  step-wise DFA (evaluated with LOOCV) and subsequently with RBF kernel SVM  supervised learning. SVM cross-validation was based on a 20-fold stratified  random sample splitting as well as a chronological split based on year of birth  to further assess the effect of secular change in sex estimation capacity.  Maximum cross-validated classification accuracy from step-wise DFA reached 94.8%  for the femur, 94.7% for the tibia, and 97.3% for the humerus, whereas SVM  cross-validated results were similar although slightly lower, mainly due to the  more strict cross-validation scheme. Our results suggest that the proposed sex  estimation method is reasonably robust to secular change, since there was limited  loss in classification accuracy between different chronological groups, despite  the presence of secular change in stature of the Greek population during the  examined period.

It is based on a fully automatic algorithm applied on 3D models for  extracting sex diagnostic morphometric features which are further processed by  computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Classification accuracy was  evaluated in a population specific and a population generic 2-way  cross-validation scheme. Population-specific accuracy for individual morphometric  features ranged from 78.5 to 96.7%, whereas population generic correct  classification ranged from 71.7 to 90.8%. Combining all sex diagnostic traits in  multi-feature sex estimation yielded correct classification performance in excess  of 91% for the entire sample, whereas the sex of about three fourths of the  sample could be determined with 100% accuracy according to posterior probability  estimates.

The last decades have seen a rise of multiple government programs to protect wolf  populations. Nevertheless, these programs have been controversial in rural areas,  product of the predation of livestock by carnivores. As a response to such  issues, governments have presented large scale economic plans to compensate the  respected owners. The current issue lies in the lack of reliable techniques that  can be used to detect the predator responsible for livestock predation. This has  led to complications when obtaining subsidies, creating conflict between  landowners and government officials. The objectives of this study therefore are  to provide a new alternative approach to differentiating between tooth marks of  different predators responsible for livestock predation.

"BioMed research international"	"Craniofacial reconstruction is to estimate a person's face model from the skull. It can be applied in many fields such as forensic medicine, archaeology, and face  animation. Craniofacial reconstruction is based on the relationship between the  skull and the face to reconstruct the facial appearance from the skull. However,  the craniofacial structure is very complex and the relationship is not the same  in different craniofacial regions. To better represent the shape changes of the  skull and face and make better use of the correlation between different local  regions, a new craniofacial reconstruction method based on region fusion strategy  is proposed in this paper. This method has the flexibility of finding the  nonlinear relationship between skull and face variables and is easy to solve.  Firstly, the skull and face are divided into five corresponding local regions;  secondly, the five regions of skull and face are mapped to low-dimensional latent  space using Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM), and the nonlinear  features between skull and face are extracted; then, least square support vector  regression (LSSVR) model is trained in latent space to establish the mapping  relationship between skull region and face region; finally, perform regional  fusion to achieve overall reconstruction. For the unknown skull, first divide the  region, then project it into the latent space of the skull region, then use the  trained LSSVR model to reconstruct the face of the corresponding region, and  finally perform regional fusion to realize the face reconstruction of the unknown  skull. The experimental results show that the method is effective. Compared with  other regression methods, our method is optimal. In addition, we add attributes  such as age and body mass index (BMI) to the mappings to achieve face  reconstruction with different attributes."

"Scientific reports"	"Accurate identification of bone surface modifications (BSM) is crucial for the taphonomic understanding of archaeological and paleontological sites. Critical  interpretations of when humans started eating meat and animal fat or when they  started using stone tools, or when they occupied new continents or interacted  with predatory guilds impinge on accurate identifications of BSM. Until now,  interpretations of Plio-Pleistocene BSM have been contentious because of the high  uncertainty in discriminating among taphonomic agents. Recently, the use of  machine learning algorithms has yielded high accuracy in the identification of  BSM. A branch of machine learning methods based on imaging, computer vision (CV),  has opened the door to a more objective and accurate method of BSM  identification. The present work has selected two extremely similar types of BSM  (cut marks made on fleshed an defleshed bones) to test the immense potential of  artificial intelligence methods. This CV approach not only produced the highest  accuracy in the classification of these types of BSM until present (95% on  complete images of BSM and 88.89% of images of only internal mark features), but  it also has enabled a method for determining which inconspicuous microscopic  features determine successful BSM discrimination. The potential of this method in  other areas of taphonomy and paleobiology is enormous."	"s41598-019-55439-6.txt"

"Journal of microscopy"	"Sedimentary abrasion and postdepositional damage to fossil remains are of great interest if considering the possible distortion they could produce in the  archaeological and paleontological record. Since their discovery, natural agents  such as trampling phenomena have been a topic of great taphonomic interest.  Nevertheless, the majority of investigation into these traces has focused almost  exclusively on their differentiation from other anthropic agents such as cut  marks. In recent years, advances into bone surface modification analysis via  geometric morphometrics have proven useful for in-depth characterization of  different taphonomic traces; including cut, tooth and percussion marks. Through  this, a preliminary study of trampling marks using advanced 3D digital microscopy  was able to detect differences between what have since been known as scratch and  graze marks. The present study expands from this, developing a more detailed  analysis of these traces. Here, we use advanced data science techniques to  provide a means of understanding trampling mark variations, contributing to our  knowledge of site formation processes. Our results show how scratch and graze  marks are a product of progressional decay and changes in cortical hardness,  providing a new means of understanding taphonomic processes. LAY DESCRIPTION: The  study of microscopic bone surface modifications in archaeology and palaeontology  is of great importance, allowing for a detailed reconstruction of the formation  of a site and providing a means of interpreting the fossil register. The damage  that sedimentary abrasion can produce, however, is likely to distort and  influence these studies, thus requiring a detailed understanding of the different  traces that can be found on different materials. Here, we use advanced 3D digital  microscopy and pattern recognition algorithms to analyse the different marks  produced in different sedimentological contexts, also controlling for other  variables such as the state of the bone when buried, the type of bone and the  time exposed to these types of damages. Through this detailed microscopic  analysis of these types of damages, we are able to conclude that morphological  variations in trampling marks are product of the state of decay when the bones  are buried."

The aims of the study  were: first, to establish the existence of alterations in the King's written  language at the onset of his first manic episode; and secondly to identify  salient sources of variation contributing to the changes. Effects on language  were sought in two control conditions (politically stressful vs. politically  tranquil periods and seasonal variation). We found clear differences in the  letter corpus, across a range of different features, in association with the  onset of mental derangement, which were driven by a combination of linguistic and  information theory features that appeared to be specific to the contrast between  acute mania and mental stability. The paucity of existing data relevant to  changes in written language in the presence of acute mania suggests that lexical,  syntactic and stylometric descriptions of written discourse produced by a cohort  of patients with a diagnosis of acute mania will be necessary to support the  diagnosis independently and to look for other periods of mental illness of the  course of the King's life, and in other historically significant figures with  similarly large archives of handwritten documents."

Focusing on Poaceae subfamilies Anomochlooideae, Pharoideae, Pueliodieae,  Bambusoideae and Oryzoideae, we observed in situ GSSCP to establish their  orientation and imaged isolated GSSCP using confocal microscopy to produce 3D  models. 3D geometric morphometrics was used to analyze GSSCP shape and size.  Classification models were applied to GSSCP from Eocene sediments from Nebraska,  USA, and Anatolia, Turkey. There were significant shape differences between  nearly all recognized GSSCP morphotypes and between clades with shared  morphotypes. Most of the Eocene GSSCP were classified as woody bamboos with some  distinctive Nebraska GSSCP classified as herbaceous bamboos. 3D morphometrics  hold great promise for GSSCP classification.

This is achieved by  evaluating sexual dimorphism of commonly used and new skeletal elements via uni-  and multi-variate metric trait analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two  skeletal traits were evaluated in 86 individuals from the William M. Bass donated  cremated collection of known sex and age-at-death. Four different predictive  models, logistic regression, random forest, neural network, and calculation of  population specific cut-off points, were used to determine the classification  accuracy (CA) of each feature and several combinations thereof. RESULTS: An  overall CA of ? 80% was obtained for 12 out of 22 features (humerus trochlea  max., and lunate length, humerus head vertical diameter, humerus head transverse  diameter, radius head max., femur head vertical diameter, patella width, patella  thickness, and talus trochlea length) using univariate analysis. Multivariate  analysis showed an increase of CA (? 95%) for certain combinations and models  (e.g., humerus trochlea max. and patella thickness). Our study shows metric  sexual dimorphism to be well preserved in calcined human remains, despite the  changes that occur during burning. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the  potential of machine learning approaches, such as neural networks, for  multivariate analyses. Using these statistical methods improves the rate of  correct sex estimations in calcined human remains and can be applied to highly  fragmented unburnt individuals from both archaeological and forensic contexts."

"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"	"The relationship between the expansion of literacy in Judah and composition of biblical texts has attracted scholarly attention for over a century. Information  on this issue can be deduced from Hebrew inscriptions from the final phase of the  first Temple period. We report our investigation of 16 inscriptions from the  Judahite desert fortress of Arad, dated ca 600 BCE-the eve of Nebuchadnezzar's  destruction of Jerusalem. The inquiry is based on new methods for image  processing and document analysis, as well as machine learning algorithms. These  techniques enable identification of the minimal number of authors in a given  group of inscriptions. Our algorithmic analysis, complemented by the textual  information, reveals a minimum of six authors within the examined inscriptions.  The results indicate that in this remote fort literacy had spread throughout the  military hierarchy, down to the quartermaster and probably even below that rank.  This implies that an educational infrastructure that could support the  composition of literary texts in Judah already existed before the destruction of  the first Temple. A similar level of literacy in this area is attested again only  400 y later, ca 200 BCE."	"Faigenbaum-Golovin et al. - 2016 - Algorithmic handwriting analysis of Judah's milita.txt"

"Forensic science international. Genetics"	"Skeletal remains are commonly subjected to various analyses, including DNA. As the remains are exposed to taphonomic processes after the death of the organism,  their physicochemical structure undergoes alterations. The success and integrity  of a DNA analysis is thus conditioned by the preservation state of the sample. In  this study, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with further data exploration was employed to  characterize the physicochemical structure of the samples and its correlation  with the preservation state of the DNA. The aim was to test the hypothesis that  ATR-FTIR-obtained spectra contain enough information to allow classification of  the samples based on the preservation of the DNA in the remains. In the study,  138 human bones and teeth originating from the 16th century BC to the 21?st  century AD were used. The samples were cleaned and powdered following the  established methodological procedures for DNA extraction. DNA was extracted and  quantified. The samples were separated into four categories based on the amount  of quantified DNA. The remaining powder was analyzed with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy  and the spectra obtained were explored to extract physicochemical information.  Before the exploration of the acquired data, samples were divided into groups A  (n?=?107) and B (n?=?31). Statistical analyses and machine learning were  performed on the group A samples. The protocol was then validated on the group B  samples, which served to make predictions on the preservation of the DNA in the  remains. The best results were achieved using a random forest learning algorithm  employing either normalized spectra, second-derivative spectra, or five  highest-ranked ratios. Even though overlapping remained, these findings indicate  that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with further exploration of the data has good  potential as a pre-screening method for evaluating DNA preservation in skeletal  remains."

"Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM"	"RATIONALE: Pre-screening of bone collagen quality is important to reduce the cost for analyses such as radiocarbon ((14) C) dating with accelerator mass  spectrometry in archaeological studies. We developed a pre-screening protocol  based on attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier-transform infrared  spectroscopy (FTIR) for assessing the chemical composition and mineralogy of  ancient bone samples. METHODS: ATR-FTIR measurements were performed on bulk bones  of diverse origin and age before collagen extraction. The percentage nitrogen of  bulk bones, as well as the weight percentage, and the percentage carbon and  nitrogen of extracted organic matter were noted. Several machine learning  algorithms were applied to the spectral data and compared for their efficacy in  screening for well preserved collagen. RESULTS: The results showed that (a) the  first derivative of the spectral data was better suited to screening than the raw  FTIR data, especially for a wider spectral range and (b) certain classification  algorithms [e.g. gradient boosting machine (GBM)] were able to efficiently  predict the degree of preservation in bone samples. CONCLUSIONS: This  pre-screening protocol can serve as a fast, concise and inexpensive pre-screening  tool for determining relative degrees of preservation before collagen extraction  and subsequent (14) C dating. The screening power based on the machine learning  techniques can be further improved by accumulating the FTIR spectral data of  bones."	"rcm.8720.txt"

Therefore, it is beneficial to consider  alternative methods to assess age at death in adult skeletons. The decrease in  bone mineral density with age was explored to generate a method to assess age at  death in human remains. A connectionist computational approach, artificial neural  networks, was employed to model femur densitometry data gathered in 100 female  individuals from the Coimbra Identified Skeletal Collection. Bone mineral density  declines consistently with age and the method performs appropriately, with mean  absolute differences between known and predicted age ranging from 9.19 to 13.49  years.

Uncontroversial evidence of meat eating goes back to 2.6  million years ago; however, little is known about the frequency and timing with  which early hominins acquired animal resources. Here, we show that the  combination of hunting and scavenging documented in some modern human foragers  may have a long evolutionary trajectory. Using a new set of artificial  intelligence methods for objective identification, we present direct evidence of  an episode of hominins scavenging from large felids-probably lions-discovered at  Olduvai Gorge (DS site, Bed I). This casts a new perspective on the diversity of  hominin carcass acquisition behaviors and survival strategies, and places some  early Pleistocene hominins in ecological proximity to African large carnivore  guilds."

These methods were  tested using cranial and pelvic sexually dimorphic traits recorded on a modern  documented collection, the Athens Collection. For their implementation, an R  package has been written to perform cross-validated (CV) sex classification and  give the discriminant function of each of the methods studied. A simple algorithm  that combines two discriminant functions is also proposed. It was found that the  differences in the classification performance between BLR, PR, CPR, LDA, QDA,  ANN, and NBC are overall small. However, LDA is simpler and more flexible than  CPR, QDA, and ANN and has a small but clear advantage over BLR, NBC, and PR.  Consequently, LDA may be preferred in skeletal sex estimation. Finally, it is  striking that the combination of pelvic and cranial traits via their discriminant  functions, determined either by BLR or LDA, removes practically any  population-specificity and yields much better predictions than the individual  functions; in fact, the prediction accuracy increases above 97%."

The study of ancient celadon is of great significance for understanding the cultural exchange, of which the classification of ancient celadon is an important part. The goal of this work was to establish a reliable celadon classification model based on EDXRF, machine learning algorithm and Mahalanobis distance. The data set for training machine learning models is constructed of 12 components in the ceramic body and glaze, which are measured by EDXRF. Comparing the predicted results of four machine learning models, the Random forest algorithm performed best on all evaluation indicators. Therefore, the Random forest was the most suitable algorithm for celadon classification with an average accuracy of 96.41% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.985. The contents of the chemical compositions of the sample were determined to be within the corresponding composition ranges of the predicted category. The chemical compositions with greater influence in identifying the categories of ancient ceramics in Random forest were chosen as the characteristic parameters. The general rules of the Mahalanobis distance from the sample to the category center were summarized and used to describe the similarity between the sample and the predicted category. The celadon classification model established by combining these two methods can make a more specific and accurate prediction. The celadon classification model was also adopted to predict the categories of samples excavated from the Jizhou kiln and Chuzhou site. The excellent prediction capability of the model was verified by comparing results with the corresponding background information of samples."	"j.ceramint.2019.12.037.txt"

From the perspective of human geography, this mountain range provides ready access to highly diverse altitudinally arranged ecosystems. The combination of a geologically and ecologically diverse landscape provides an exceptional context to explore the potential of strontium isotopes to track the movements of people and the conveyance of material culture. Here we develop an isotopic landscape of bioavailable strontium (87Sr/86Sr) that is applied to reconstruct human paleogeography across time in the southern Andes of Argentina and Chile (31 degrees-34 degrees S). These results come from a macro-regional sampling of rodents (N = 65) and plants (N = 26) from modern and archeological contexts. This \Southern Andean Strontium Transect\\" extends over 350 km across the Andes, encompassing the main geological provinces between the Pacific coast (Chile) and the eastern lowlands (Argentina). We follow a recently developed approach to isoscape construction based on Random Forest regression and GIS analysis. Our results suggest that bioavailable strontium is tightly linked with bedrock geology and offers a highly resolved proxy to track human paleogeography involving the levels of territories or daily mobility and anomalous events that disrupt home ranges, such as migration. The southern Andes provide an ideal geological setting to develop this approach, since the geological variation in rock age and composition produces distinctive isotopic signatures for each main biogeographical region. Finally, we apply this framework to a set of results from human remains from the Uspallata Valley in Mendoza (Argentina), to assess the incidence of migration in the key period of the consolidation of agropastoral economies between AD 800 and 1400. The application of the isoscape to the values from human remains confirms the persistence of human groups with relatively restricted territories encompassing Uspallata and the adjacent Precordillera between AD 800 and 1500. We also identify a pulse of human migration between AD 1280 and 1420, shortly preceding the Inka conquest. Looking forward, we expect to converge with ongoing efforts in South America to build a continental research framework to track the movement of people, animals, and artifacts across space and time.\""	"Barberena et al. - 2021 - Bioavailable Strontium, Human Paleogeography, and .txt"

These expectations are expressed using natural languages. To design software meeting the needs of the customer and the stakeholders, the intentions, feedback and reviews are to be understood accurately and without ambiguity.

The issues mentioned in the previous thought frequently result in the program not satisfying the expectation of the stakeholders. In particular, for non-functional requirements, clients rarely emphasize these specifications as much as they might be justified. Identifying, classifying and reconciling the requirements is one of the main duty of the System Analyst, which without using a proper tool, can be very demanding and time-consuming. Tools which support text processing are expected to improve the accuracy of identification and classification of requirements even in an unstructured set of inputs.

The complexity of these ancient and historical materials, which are chemically heterogeneous, the product of alteration processes, and inherently not reproducible, is a major obstacle to a thorough understanding of their making and long-term behavior (e.g., fossilization). These challenges required the development of methodologies and instruments coupling imaging and data processing approaches that are optimized for the specific properties of the materials. This Account discusses how these characteristics not only constrain their study but also open up specific innovative avenues for providing key historical information. Synchrotron methods have extensively been used since the late 1990s to study heritage objects, in particular for their potential to provide speciation information from excitation spectroscopies and to image complex heritage objects and samples in two and three dimensions at high resolution. We examine in practice how the identification of key intrinsic chemical specificities has offered fertile ground for the development of novel synchrotron approaches allowing a better stochastic description of the properties of ancient and historical materials. These developments encompass three main aspects: (1) The multiscale heterogeneity of these materials can provide an essential source of information in the development of probes targeting their multiple scales of homogeneity. (2) Chemical alteration can be described in many ways, e.g., by segmenting datasets in a semiquantitative way to jointly inform morphological and chemical transformation pathways. (3) The intrinsic individuality of chemical signatures in artifacts triggers the development of specific strategies, such as those focusing on weak signal detection. We propose a rereading of the advent of these new methodologies for analysis and characterization and examine how they have led to innovative strategies combining materials science, instrument development, history, and data science. In particular, we show that spectral imaging and the search for correlations in image datasets have provided a powerful way to address what archeologists have called the uncertainty and ambiguity of the material record. This approach has implications beyond synchrotron techniques and extends in particular to a series of rapidly developing approaches that couple spectral and spatial information, as in hyperspectral imaging and spatially resolved mass spectrometry. The preeminence of correlations holds promise for the future development of machine learning methods for processing data on historical objects. Beyond heritage, these developments are an original source of inspiration for the study of materials in many related fields, such as environmental, geochemical, or life sciences, which deal with systems whose alteration and heterogeneity cannot be neglected."

This method, when applied to controlled experimental marks on bones, yielded the highest rate documented to date of accurate classification (92%) of cut, tooth and trampling marks. After testing this method experimentally, it was applied to published images of some important traces purportedly indicating a very ancient hominin presence in Africa, America and Europe.

There are traditional methods for constructing models that give good results for stature estimation. In this paper, we aim to investigate the usefulness of using machine learning-based models to approximate stature. Assuming that the stature of an individual is indirectly related to bone measurement values, we can derive methods that learn from archaeological data and construct models that give good estimates of the stature. Two novel machine learning-based regression models for stature estimation are proposed in this paper. Experiments using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms were performed on samples from the Terry Collection Postcranial Osteometric Database, and the obtained results are discussed and compared with the results from other similar studies. The experimental evaluations indicate that the machine learning-based regression models are efficient for the stature estimation of archaeological remains and highlight the potential of our proposal.

However, due to the costs and efforts required for ancient biomolecular analysis, there has been considerable research into development of accurate and efficient screening approaches for archaeological remains. FTIR spectroscopy is one such approach that has been considered for screening of proteins, but its widespread use has been hindered by the fact that its predictive accuracy can vary widely depending on the extent of sample preservation and the instrument used. Further, screening methods for ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis are scarce. Here we present a new approach to vastly improve upon FTIR-based screening methods prior to ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) and aDNA analysis through the use of random forest-based machine learning. To do so, we use ATR-FTIR to examine three sets of archaeological bone assemblages and analyse them by ZooMS (for taxonomic identification). Two of these are from Palaeolithic contexts, dominated by terrestrial fauna and include specimens with a variety of preservational conditions. The third set consists of Holocene faunal remains, with variable levels of preservation and is dominated by cetaceans. Using the Holocene faunal remains, we were able to more consistently evaluate ATR-FTIR-based screening for mtDNA as well as ZooMS success. We report on the potential of machine learning in ATR-FTIR-based screening for ancient mtDNA analysis, and our machine learning models conclusively improve the accuracy prior to usage of ATR-FTIR-based screening for ZooMS by 20?40%. The results also suggest this approach potentially allows for a universal screening system, applicable across multiple sites and largely independent of the spectrometers used."

Such facilities are rare in Egypt and modern dating techniques which are indispensable in Geoarchaeology to establish a robust chronology are not available, as sample transport is restricted and Egypt does not provide OSL or AMS C-14 laboratories. With these preconditions, we evaluate the usability of pXRF geochemical data for the dating of archaeological sediments with machine learning techniques. The sample material was collected via sampling of archaeological sections and profile walls from archaeological excavations in the northwestern Nile delta at the settlement site Buto (Tell el-Fara'in) and Kom el-Gir. Additionally, samples were taken from sediments and cultural layers uncovered from their surroundings using vibracore corings with open steel auger heads. In this methodological approach, we examine the applicability of pXRF methods and test the sample data for distinct geochemical differences between the main settlement phases with multivariate statistical methods. The dating is based on the training of artificial neural networks with pXRF data from archaeological material of well-dated context to date test data of cultural layers within the vibracores.

This is the first time this method has been used in an archaeological setting. The results show that these bones were mostly broken by anthropic action, while some were slightly ravaged by carnivores, probably hyaenas.

These tiny artifacts tend to become embedded in the locations where they were first deposited and are less vulnerable to post-depositional movement, making microdebitage an important artifact class for identifying primary areas of stone tool production. Traditional microdebitage analysis, however, can take multiple hours spread over several days to complete. Because of this, microdebitage analysis is typically completed in very small areas of sites due to the intensive time and labor commitment required. Recently, however, my colleagues and I have developed a novel, interdisciplinary method that combines dynamic image analysis and machine learning to analyze microdebitage taken from soil samples at archaeological sites. Analyses of experimental microdebitage demonstrated that microdebitage could be accurately and efficiently identified within archaeological soil samples using this method. In the present study, we apply these methods to soil samples taken from the Maya Capital of Tamarindito in Guatemala to verify whether these methods remain accurate when applied to archaeological contexts."

Other researchers have argued that multivariate methods can efficiently separate both types of marks. Differentiating both taphonomic agents is crucial for determining the ear-liest evidence of carcass processing by hominins. Here, we use an updated machine learning approach (discarding artificially bootstrapping the original imbalanced samples) to show that microscopic features shaped as categorical variables, corresponding to intrinsic properties of mark structure, can accurately discriminate both types of bone modifications. We also implement new deep-learning methods that objectively achieve the highest accuracy in differentiating cut marks from crocodile tooth scores (99% of testing sets). The present study shows that there are precise ways of differentiating both taphonomic agents, and this invites taphonomists to apply them to controversial paleontological and archaeological specimens.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Drawing on developments in computer vision and machine learning, this has the potential to fundamentally recast the capacity of archaeological prospection to cover large areas and deal with mass data, breaking a dependency on human resource. Without such developments, the potential of the vast amount of archaeological information embedded in large topographic and image-based datasets cannot be realized. The purpose of the case study reported on here is to assess existing developments in a Norwegian study against digital topographic data for the island of Arran, Scotland, examining the transferability of the approach and providing a proof of concept in a Scottish context. For Arran, three monument classes were assessed - prehistoric roundhouses, shieling huts of medieval or post-medieval date, and small clearance cairns. These present different challenges to detection, with preliminary results ranging from a manageable mix of false positives and true identifications to the chaotic. The influence of variable morphology and the occurrence of other, largely natural, objects of confusion in the landscape is discussed, highlighting the potential improvements in automated detection routines offered by adding anthropogenic and natural false positives to additional confusion classes."

In areas where numerous rock art sites exist, much of the rock art is unidentified and therefore remains, unrecorded and unresearched. Manually identifying rock art is time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to automate many processes in rock art research, which can be accomplished by Machine Learning. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can greatly facilitate rock art research in many ways, such as through Object Recognition and Detection, Motif Extraction, Object Reconstruction, Image Knowledge Graphs, and Representations. This article is a reflective work on the future of ML for rock art research. As a proof-of-concept, it presents a machine learning method based on recent advances in deep learning to train a model to identify images with painted rock art (pictograms). The efficacy of the proposed method is shown using data collected from fieldwork in Australia.

Our descriptor is based on a multi-view approach of curvature features, consisting of the following steps: pose normalization of 3D models, local curvature descriptor calculation, construction of 3D shape descriptor using the multi-view approach and curvature maps, and dimensionality reduction by random projections. We generate two descriptors from two different paradigms: 1) handcrafted, wherein the descriptor is manually designed for object feature extraction, and directly passed on to the classifier and 2) machine learnt, in which the descriptor automatically learns the object features through a pretrained deep neural network model (VGG-16) for transfer learning and passed on to the classifier. These descriptors are applied to two different archaeological datasets: 1) non-public Mexican dataset, represented by a collection of 963 3D archaeological objects from the Templo Mayor Museum in Mexico City that includes anthropomorphic sculptures, figurines, masks, ceramic vessels, and musical instruments; and 2) 3D pottery content-based retrieval benchmark dataset, consisting of 411 objects. Once the multi-view descriptors are obtained, we evaluate their effectiveness by using the following object classification schemes: K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and structured support vector machine. Our object descriptors classification results are compared against five popular 3D descriptors in the literature, namely, rotation invariant spherical harmonic, histogram of spherical orientations, signature of histograms of orientations, symmetry descriptor, and reflective symmetry descriptor. Experimentally, we were able to verify that our machine learnt and handcrafted descriptors offer the best classification accuracy (20% better on average than comparative descriptors), independently of the classification methods. Our proposed descriptors are able to capture sufficient information to discern among different classes, concluding that it adequately characterizes the datasets."	"ACCESS.2018.2886791.txt"

At present, their specific manufacture dates and workshop localities are unknown. Relying on subjective, visual methods, scholars have grappled with their classification and regional attribution for over a century. This study combines visual approaches with machine learning techniques to offer data-driven perspectives on the classification and attribution of this Iron Age corpus. The study sample consists of 162 sculptures of female figures that have been conventionally attributed to three main regional carving traditions: \Phoenician,\\" \\"North Syrian,\\" and \\"Syrian/South Syrian\\". We have developed an algorithm that clusters the ivories based on a combination of descriptive and anthropometric data. The resulting categories, which are based on purely statistical criteria, show good agreement with conventional art historical classifications, while revealing new insights, especially with regard to the \\"Syrian/South Syrian\\" tradition. Specifically, we have determined that objects of the Syrian/South Syrian tradition might be more closely related to Phoenician objects than to North Syrian objects. We also reconsider the classification of a subset of \\"Phoenician\\" objects, and we confirm Syrian/South Syrian stylistic subgroups, the geographic distribution of which might illuminate Neo-Assyrian acquisition networks. Additionally, we have identified the features in our cluster assignments that might be diagnostic of regional traditions. In short, our study both corroborates traditional visual classifications and demonstrates how machine learning techniques may be employed to retrieve complementary information not accessible through an exclusively visual analysis.

Analyses of this type, however, can often be conditioned by subjectivity based on the perspective of the analyst. This study presents a novel use of Machine Learning algorithms for pattern recognition techniques in the automated separation and identification of fossiliferous levels. This approach can be divided into three main steps including: (1) unsupervised Machine Learning for density based clustering (2) expert-in-the-loop Collaborative Intelligence Learning for the integration of geological data followed by (3) supervised learning for the final fine-tuning of fossiliferous level models. For evaluation of these techniques, this method was tested in two Late Miocene sites of the Batallones Butte paleontological complex (Madrid, Spain). Here we show Machine Learning analyses to be a valuable tool for the processing of spatial data in an efficient and quantitative manner, successfully identifying the presence of discrete fossiliferous levels in both Batallones-3 and Batallones-10.

Archaeologists use insights from the experimental replication of lithics to understand phenomena such as the behaviours and cognitive capacities required to manufacture them. However, such experiments can require large amounts of time and raw materials, and achieving sufficient control of key variables can be difficult. A computer program able to accurately simulate stone tool production would make lithic experimentation faster, more accessible, reproducible, less biased, and may lead to reliable insights into the factors that structure the archaeological record. We present here a proof of concept for a machine learning-based virtual knapping framework capable of quickly and accurately predicting flake removals from 3D cores using a conditional adversarial neural network (CGAN). We programmatically generated a testing dataset of standardised 3D cores with flakes knapped from them. After training, the CGAN accurately predicted the length, volume, width, and shape of these flake removals using the intact core surface information alone. This demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning for investigating lithic production virtually. With a larger training sample and validation against archaeological data, virtual knapping could enable fast, cheap, and highly-reproducible virtual lithic experimentation."

Recent technological advances applied to taphonomy have provided new insight into carnivore BSMs. A newly developed part of this work relies on Geometric Morphometrics (GMM) studies aimed at discerning carnivore agency through the morphologic characterization of tooth scores and pits.

However, the heuristics of ML algorithms depend tightly on the objectivity in raw data collection. The use of multivariate approaches in which variables are independently scored by the analyst introduces a subjective bias. In this work, I show that different analysts producing raw data on the same testing data set can lead to widely divergent BSM classifications and interpretations using the same powerful ML algorithms. It is emphasized that until an objective non-biasing method of raw data collection is implemented, BSM classification carried out via statistical tests will remain heuristically limited.

However, the regional variables of large-scale gradients are only considered rarely. Also, settlement modelling applications are often impeded by fragmentary and error-prone datasets. Thus, in current-day Lithuania, in order to study the dynamics of settlement distributional rules, we implemented a modelling strategy that involves the use of statistical and machine learning methods with null model simulations and that is less affected by the incompleteness of datasets and the scales of variables. In this study, we used regional variables in order to test their usefulness while providing a general understanding of the large-scale processes that governed settlement distribution in prehistory. This study encompassed six time intervals between the Palaeolithic and Iron Ages. The obtained results consisted of regional settlement predictive maps, estimations of random forest variable importance and performances of GAM models, as well as determinations of Besag's L-functions of settlement patterns and Euclidean distances between the regional variables at the settlement sites. We detected decreasing spatial autocorrelation of the settlement prediction maps and settlement patterns, declining variable importance and model performance, as well as increasing regional environmental diversity of the settlement sites. A marked manifestation of these trends was observed between the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. This also corresponded to a major change in the constitution of the most important variables of the settlement distributions. We associate these findings with technological and lifestyle changes in the southern Baltic region, interpreting them as causing a roughening of the human adaptive landscape increasing the specificity, number and complexity of the settlement distributional rules. Our study revealed that, even for incomplete datasets and spatial autocorrelation, the application of advanced statistical/machine learning techniques was able to provide new insights into the processes that governed the socio-cultural evolution and spatial dynamics of humans in prehistory."

Due to restrictions on exporting geological samples from Egypt, modern geoscientific studies in the Nile Delta lack the possibility of dating the investigated sediments and geological features by standard techniques such as OSL or AMS C-14; therefore, this study aims to validate a new approach using machine-learning algorithms on portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) data. Archaeologically dated sediments from the archaeological excavations of Buto (Tell el-Fara'in; on-site) that pXRF analyses have geochemically characterized serve as training data for running and comparing Neural Nets, Random Forests, and single-decision trees. The established pXRF fingerprints are transferred via machine-learning algorithms to set up a chronology for undated sediments from sediment cores (i.e., the test data) of the nearby surroundings (off-site). Neural Nets and Random Forests work fine in dating sediments and deliver the best classification results compared with single-decision trees, which struggle with outliers and tend to overfit the training data. Furthermore, Random Forests can be modeled faster and are easier to understand than the complex, less transparent Neural Nets. Therefore, Random Forests provide the best algorithm for studies like this. Furthermore, river features east of Kom el-Gir are dated to pre-Ptolemaic times (before 332 B.C.) when Kom el-Gir had possibly not yet been settled. The research in this paper shows the success of close interactions from various scientific disciplines (Geoinformatics, Physical Geography, Archaeology, Ancient History) to decipher landscape evolution in the long-term-settled Nile Delta's environs using machine learning.

Morphometric methods have played an increasingly large role in such quantitative assessments. However, standard approaches to morphometric analyses are often poorly suited to many artifact types as much variation of interest to archeologists cannot be quantified adequately by sparse sets of landmarks or semilandmarks. Use of measurement conventions also requires that investigators know which aspects of the artifacts under consideration are important to include at the outset of an investigation. In this review results obtained from landmark-semilandmark-based, and image pixel-based assessments of a common set of Paleoindian fluted projectile points are compared. Results confirm that, by itself, PCA is unsuited for the assessment of between-group differences irrespective of data type, but can be useful as a transformation to reduce the dimensionality of a morphological dataset while retaining its effective information content. Landmark-semilandmark data analysed using geometric morphometric methods delivered the lowest-quality results whereas image pixel data analysed by the Naive Bayes machine-learning classifier delivered the highest. Direct analyses of artifact images using geometric morphometric methods delivered very good results. These findings suggest that the direct analyses of digital images and 3D scans, using either geometric morphometric data-analysis methods or machine-learning procedures, can provide archaeologists with tools that improve and extend the scope of their assessments of a wide range of artifact types.

These deposits provide important insights into Native American socioeconomic organization but are also quite rare: only about 50 such rings have been documented to date. Recent work using automated LiDAR analysis demonstrates that many more shell rings likely exist than are currently recorded in state archaeological databases. Here, we use deep learning, a form of machine intelligence, to detect shell ring deposits and identify their geographic range in LiDAR data from South Carolina. We corroborate our results using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), multispectral data, and a random forest analysis. We conclude that a greater number of shell rings exist and that their distribution expanded further north than currently documented. Our evidence suggests that ring-construction was a more widespread and common practice during the mid-Holocene."	"j.jas.2021.105433.txt"

High-throughput peptide mass fingerprinting has been largely applied to bacterial identification, but increasingly used to identify archaeological and palaeontological skeletal material to yield information on past environments and human-animal interaction. However, as applications move away from predominantly domesticate and the more abundant wild fauna to a much wider range of less common taxa that do not yet have genetically-derived sequence information, robust methods of species identification and biomarker selection need to be determined. Results: Here we developed a supervised machine learning algorithm for classifying the species of ancient remains based on collagen fingerprinting. The aim was to minimise requirements on prior knowledge of known species while yielding satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. The algorithm uses iterations of a modified random forest classifier with a similarity scoring system to expand its identified samples. We tested it on a set of 6805 spectra and found that a high level of accuracy can be achieved with a training set of five identified specimens per taxon. Conclusions: This method consistently achieves higher accuracy than two-dimensional principal component analysis and similar accuracy with hierarchical clustering using optimised parameters, which greatly reduces requirements for human input. Within the vertebrata, we demonstrate that this method was able to achieve the taxonomic resolution of family or sub-family level whereas the genus- or species-level identification may require manual interpretation or further experiments. In addition, it also identifies additional species biomarkers than those previously published."	"Gu et Buckley - 2018 - Semi-supervised machine learning for automated spe.txt"

A total of 48 fragments have been discovered in three locations; Bolgar, the Moscow Kremlin (MosKremlin), and Selitrennoe settlement (Selitrennoe). The assemblages were subjected to INAA in order to determine the concentrations of 37 elements in mg/kg. The data were analyzed using geochemical, bivariate, and multivariate statistical techniques. To classify the fragments according to their origin hierarchical clustering (HCA), linear discriminant (LDA), and principal component analyses (PCA) were used. Based on the INAA results, the first attempt was made to apply machine learning methods to the study of artifacts in Russia. The results show that they are reliable and powerful in extracting information about critical elements for identifying ceramic fragments and using them as chemical fingerprints. Chromium was the most useful element and was used in conjunction with other elements as a fingerprint to distinguish sherds. Chemical and statistical analyses help to establish of reference groups for medieval archeological pottery, which will be used in the future to classify and identify various unknown sherds. These reference groups serve as baseline data for determining the fragment's place of manufacture and are considered a reasonable judgment based on experimental data."

This most crucial part of taphonomic analysis of the archaeological human record has been controversial due to highly subjective interpretations of BSM. Here, we use a sample of 79 trampling and cut marks to compare the accuracy in mark identification on bones by human experts and computer trained algorithms. We demonstrate that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and support vector machines (SVM) can recognize marks with accuracy that far exceeds that of human experts. Automated recognition and analysis of BSM using DCNN can achieve an accuracy of 91% of correct identification of cut and trampling marks versus a much lower accuracy rate (63%) obtained by trained human experts. This success underscores the capability of machine learning algorithms to help resolve controversies in taphonomic research and, more specifically, in the study of bone surface modifications.

Species identification is hindered because of the few taxonomically informative structures available, making the task laborious and genus definition controversial. Thus, its taxonomy is one of the most complex among Nematoda. Eggs are the parasitic structures most viewed in coprological analysis in both modern and ancient samples; consequently, their presence is indicative of positive diagnosis for infection. The structure of the egg could play a role in genera or species discrimination. Institutional biological collections are taxonomic repositories of specimens described and strictly identified by systematics specialists.MethodsThe present work aims to characterize eggs of capillariid species deposited in institutional helminth collections and to process the morphological, morphometric and ecological data using machine learning (ML) as a new approach for taxonomic identification. Specimens of 28 species and 8 genera deposited at ColecAo Helmintologica do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (CHIOC, IOC/FIOCRUZ/Brazil) and Collection de Nematodes Zooparasites du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris (MNHN/France) were examined under light microscopy. In the morphological and morphometric analyses (MM), the total length and width of eggs as well as plugs and shell thickness were considered. In addition, eggshell ornamentations and ecological parameters of the geographical location (GL) and host (H) were included.ResultsThe performance of the logistic model tree (LMT) algorithm showed the highest values in all metrics compared with the other algorithms. Algorithm J48 produced the most reliable decision tree for species identification alongside REPTree. The Majority Voting algorithm showed high metric values, but the combined classifiers did not attenuate the errors revealed in each algorithm alone. The statistical evaluation of the dataset indicated a significant difference between trees, with GL+H+MM and MM only with the best scores.ConclusionsThe present research proposed a novel procedure for taxonomic species identification, integrating data from centenary biological collections and the logic of artificial intelligence techniques.

This traditional approach has been challenged, however, by the current new practices in archaeological studies, which tend to rely on more scientific methods (e.g. information systems) to understand the wider context of the socio-cultural aspects of past societies. For example, the Nabataean studies, which for more than seventeen decades after the rediscovery of Petra in 1812, are based on the art historical analysis of the rock-cut facades of the the city of Petra. The wider story of the socio-cultural, political, and economic aspects of the Nabataean culture is still not well understood. Just recently archaeological research was undertaken to improve the understanding of the Nabaatean phenomenon from outside Petra. This paper discusses this new attempt to investigate the spatial organization and land use of Wadi Musa during the Nabataean period based on GIS analysis and new archaeological discoveries. Utilizing GIS in discovering historical phenomena provides a new perspective for analysis, whereby structures are treated not as individual archaeological items but rather as a system. This paper also presents a case study that demonstrates the significance of using GIS for historical research by shedding light on the temporal variation of Wadi Musa settlements with special focus on the paleo-landuse of the Nabatean period. The resulting reconstructed map indicates that Wadi Musa was well planned with special zones for elite residents, industry, rural communities, and agriculture. Social segregation/stratification is also well indicated in the plan of the city. The reconstructed map indicates that the strategy for Nabataean land use for Wadi Musa was to use it as a green zone around the city of Gaia."	"Farajat_2021.txt"
"UAE6HTLG"	"journalArticle"	2022	"Prasomphan, S"	"Toward Fine-grained Image Retrieval with Adaptive Deep Learning for Cultural Heritage Image"	"COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING"	"Fine-grained image classification is a challenging research topic because of the high degree of similarity among categories and the high degree of dissimilarity for a specific category caused by different poses and scales. A cultural heritage image is one of the fine-grained images because each image has the same similarity in most cases. Using the classification technique, distinguishing cultural heritage architecture may be difficult. This study proposes a cultural heritage content retrieval method using adaptive deep learning for fine-grained image retrieval. The key contribution of this research was the creation of a retrieval model that could handle incremental streams of new categories while maintaining its past performance in old categories and not losing the old categorization of a cultural heritage image. The goal of the proposed method is to perform a retrieval task for classes. Incremental learning for new classes was conducted to reduce the re-training process. In this step, the original class is not necessary for re-training which we call an adaptive deep learning technique. Cultural heritage in the case of Thai archaeological site architecture was retrieved through machine learning and image processing. We analyze the experimental results of incremental learning for fine-grained images with images of Thai archaeological site architecture from world heritage provinces in Thailand, which have a similar architecture. Using a fine-grained image retrieval technique for this group of cultural heritage images in a database can solve the problem of a high degree of similarity among categories and a high degree of dissimilarity for a specific category. The proposed method for retrieving the correct image from a database can deliver an average accuracy of 85 percent. Adaptive deep learning for fine-grained image retrieval was used to retrieve cultural heritage content, and it outperformed state-of-theart methods in fine-grained image retrieval."

The association of heterogeneous information to 3D data by means of automated segmentation and classification methods can help to characterize, describe and better interpret the object under study. Indeed, the high complexity of 3D data along with the large diversity of heritage assets themselves have constituted segmentation and classification methods as currently active research topics. Although machine learning methods brought great progress in this respect, few advances have been developed in relation to cultural heritage 3D data. Starting from the existing literature, this paper aims to develop, explore and validate reliable and efficient automated procedures for the classification of 3D data (point clouds or polygonal mesh models) of heritage scenarios. In more detail, the proposed solution works on 2D data (texture-based approach) or directly on the 3D data (geometry-based approach) with supervised or unsupervised machine learning strategies. The method was applied and validated on four different archaeological/architectural scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is reliable and replicable and it is effective for restoration and documentation purposes, providing metric information e.g. of damaged areas to be restored."

Through structure from motion (SfM) and multi-view-stereo (MVS) techniques, aerial imagery can provide a low-cost alternative compared to bathymetric LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) surveys, as it offers additional important visual information and higher spatial resolution. Nevertheless, water refraction poses significant challenges on depth determination. Till now, this problem has been addressed through customized image-based refraction correction algorithms or by modifying the collinearity equation. In this article, in order to overcome the water refraction errors in a massive and accurate way, we employ machine learning tools, which are able to learn the systematic underestimation of the estimated depths. In particular, an SVR (support vector regression) model was developed, based on known depth observations from bathymetric LiDAR surveys, which is able to accurately recover bathymetry from point clouds derived from SfM-MVS procedures. Experimental results and validation were based on datasets derived from different test-sites, and demonstrated the high potential of our approach. Moreover, we exploited the fusion of LiDAR and image-based point clouds towards addressing challenges of both modalities in problematic areas."	"rs11192225.txt"

A crucial component of iron manufacturing was the production of charcoal, which was often created in charcoal piles. These features are visible in LiDAR (light detection and ranging) datasets. These charcoal piles vary in their morphology by region, and training data for some feature types are severely lacking. Here, we investigate the potential for machine automation to aid archaeologists in recording charcoal piles with limited training data availability in a forested region of Jonkoping County, Sweden. We first use hydrological depression algorithms to conduct a preliminary assessment of the study region and compile suitable training data for charcoal production sites. Then, we use these datasets to train a series of RetinaNet deep learning models, which are less computationally expensive than many popular deep learning architectures (e.g., R-CNNs), allowing for greater usability. Together, our results demonstrate how charcoal piles can be automatically extracted from LiDAR datasets, which has great implications for improving our understanding of the long-term environmental impact of the iron industry across Northern Europe. Furthermore, our workflow for developing and implementing deep learning models for archaeological research can expand the use of such methods to regions that lack suitable training data."

Such detailed representations pose difficult questions not only in their design (the generality-realism trade-off) but also about the inferences that are made from them. The historical sciences are faced with seeking to make robust inferences from limited, potentially biased and/or incomplete samples from uncontrolled systems, and as a result have sometimes employed narrative explanation. By contrast, simulation models can be used experimentally and can generate large amounts of data. Here, using an agent-based model of hunter-gatherer foraging in a previously unexplored ecosystem, we consider how narratives might be identified from the trajectories produced by simulations. We show how machine learning methods can isolate qualitatively similar types of model behaviour based on summaries of model outcomes and time series. We stand to learn from this approach because it enables us to answer two questions: (i) under what conditions (representations and/or parameterisations) do we observe in the model what is recorded in the archaeological and/or palaeoenvironmental record? and (ii) does the model yield unobserved dynamics? If so, are they plausible? Using models to develop narratives is a logical extension of the bottom-up approach inherent in agent-based modelling and has the potential, alongside conventional methods of model evaluation, to aid in learning from the rich dynamics of such simulations."

A geometric-morphometric analysis of surface bone modifications of a Paranthropus boisei skeleton"	"QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL"	"Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania) is one of the key areas for the study of human origins, given the sheer abundance of archaeological and paleontological sites discovered. Several of these archaeological sites have yielded numerous hominin fossils and traces of their activities, thus offering invaluable insights into the nature and origins of human behavior. Nevertheless, certain taphonomic discussions that have been of great importance for the study of the South African cave sites have remained unnoticed in East Africa. One of these issues revolves around the interpretation of Paranthropus as a common prey of predators. In this paper, we analyze the postcranial remains of OH80, a partial skeleton of a Paranthropus boisei discovered at the BK site (Bell Korongo, Bed II of Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) in 2010. Some of the specimens of this skeleton have been reported to show surface modifications tentatively associated to the action of carnivores. Here, several pits observed on OH80-12, the Paranthropus boisei femur, were digitally reconstructed and analyzed through geometric morphometrics to determine the nature of the marks. The OH80-12 marks are compared with a modern sample of percussion marks and several carnivore tooth pits, since the action of both agents has previously been identified at the site and can sometimes result in equifinality problems. Alongside already published geometric morphometric tests, here we present a very newly developed approach based on the combination of geometric morphometric data and the training of machine learning algorithms. Both methodologies highlight that OH80 was consumed by carnivores, being a felid the most likely modifying agent."	"j.quaint.2019.05.029.txt"

Traditionally, it is assumed that cremations phased out at the start of the Early Middle Ages, when the inhumation practice became more numerous. However, recent research (Lippok, 2020) shows that cremations might be more prevalent than previously assumed. Due to research efforts being concentrated on furnished inhumations, cremations and other types of burials have not received their share of research interest. It is suspected that unknown Early Medieval cremations may be found in grey literature research reports. The rapidly growing document collection requires more efficient methods to search through this big data, as manual searching is too time intensive. AGNES uses machine learning to allow searching on archaeological concepts (such as time periods and artefacts) in full texts, solving common problems with synonymy and polysemy. This paper describes a controlled search for Early Medieval cremations in the Netherlands, and a comparison of the new information uncovered from the reports to prior knowledge on the topic. The queries resulted in 2541 hits. Twenty-three Early Medieval cremations that were previously unknown to experts were uncovered, and 31 (of 77) known sites were identified. Forty-one possibly interesting documents were noted, where it was not clear from the report if Early Medieval cremations were present. 2446 documents were not relevant to the study for various reasons. The 23 new sites are an increase of 30% over the existing knowledge of experts. In the last 20 years only nine new sites featuring Early Medieval cremations were discovered, so being able to add another 23 is a major development. Adding previously unknown Early Medieval cremations to the dataset challenges the existing bias for inhumation graves, and supports striving towards viewing the Early Medieval burial repertoire as more heterogeneous and representative. This indicates that AGNES is useful for archaeological research, and the uncovered information can lead to a more cohesive view of the past."	"j.jas.2021.105456.txt"

Acquiring representative, high quality data is the most important criterion to assess the value of any spatial analysis, however, there are many situations in which these criteria cannot be fulfilled. Archived data, collected in the past, for which analysis cannot be repeated or supplemented is a very common information source. Archaeological data collected at a regional extent during years of field work and superficial observations are an additional example. Such data rarely provide representative samples and are usually imbalanced; only very few examples contain useful data, while many examples remain without any archaeological traces. In spite of these limitations archaeological information presented in the form of maps can be a useful and helpful tool to analyse the spatial patterns of some phenomena and, from a more practical point of view, a tool to predict the location of undiscovered occurrences. The primary goal of this paper is to present a methodology for modelling spatial patterns based on imbalanced categorical data which do not fulfil the criteria of spatial representation and incorporates uncertainty in its decision process. This concept will be discussed using a collection of Stone Age sites and set of environmental variables from the postglacial lowlands in Western Poland. We will propose a machine-learning system which adopts CART through bootstrap simulation to incorporate uncertainty into the spatial model and utilise that uncertainty in the decision-making process. Finally, we will describe the relationships between the model and environmental variables and present our results in cartographic form using the principles of decision-tree cartography."

With a deep learning approach for post-mortem interval estimation (ranging from one day to 2000 years) in bones, the estimation can be approximated with high precision. It is challenging to estimate the post-mortem interval (PMI) of skeletal remains within a forensic context. As a result of their interactions with the environment, bones undergo several chemical and physical changes after death. So far, multiple methods have been used to follow up on post-mortem changes. There is, however, no definitive way to estimate the PMI of skeletal remains. This research aimed to propose a methodology capable of estimating the PMI using micro-computed tomography measurements of 104 human skeletal remains with PMIs between one day and 2000 years. The present study indicates that micro-computed tomography could be considered an objective and precise method of PMI evaluation in forensic medicine. The measured parameters show a significant difference regarding the PMI for Cort Porosity p < 0.001, BV/TV p > 0.001, Mean1 p > 0.001 and Mean2 p > 0.005. Using a machine learning approach, the neural network showed an accuracy of 99% for distinguishing between samples with a PMI of less than 100 years and archaeological samples."

In this work, we focus on the task of recovering characters and symbols from images of corrupted archaeological artifacts where data is partially erased, occluded, or overwritten by other data. Such phenomena can be widely observed in image datasets of palimpsests and petroglyphs consisting of erased, overwritten, and in general heavily degraded data. Segmentation and binarization are typically applied to such images to detect and recover characters and symbols from their background. However, these methods mainly focus on the visible data while in our case, due to large corruption, both visible and invisible information should be considered. For example, computing the segmentation mask of an occluded character requires also labeling invisible pixels and missing parts. In this work, we introduce a deep neural network that computes character segmentation in palimpsests and petroglyphs while overcoming occlusions, missing parts, and degradation. Our network has inference abilities, thus, not only segmenting the symbol's foreground pixels but also inferring and completing missing and corrupted parts. Since palimpsests and petroglyphs have very limited annotated ground-truth data, we also introduce data augmentation tools to properly train our network.

Through its ability to penetrate forest canopies and detect microlandforms, Airborne Laser Scanning data reveal archaeological relics over large areas, from periods older than the first available Historical Topographic Maps. Mapping these traces from ALS-derived data (e.g. Digital Elevation Model (DEM)) thus allows for a determination of a new temporal baseline in order to evaluate the effects of a longer history on current patterns of biodiversity. Here, we evaluate the ability of traditional machine learning (Random Forest-RF) and deep learning (Fully Connected Networks-FCN) models to detect Medieval Terraced slopes and Ridges and Furrows (RaF) from an ALS-derived DEM in the southern Vosges (1462 km(2)). We used a combination of Local Binary Patterns and topographical metrics to measure properties of FFS and to train detection models. We then assessed the relative performance of each model semantically and spatially. Our results demonstrated the high suitability of our approach for reproducing major trends in the landscape with a high level of similarity between the predicted and reference spatial patterns (Structural Similarity Index - SSIM > 0.75). RF outperformed FCN for Terraced Slopes, whilst minimizing the false positive rate. FCN slightly outperformed RF for the RaF dataset but showed promising abilities to survey unseen data with a low sensitivity to annotation errors.

However, recognition of ceramics is still a manual, time-consuming activity, reliant on analogue catalogues created by specialists, held in archives and libraries. The ArchAIDE project worked to streamline, optimise, and economise the mundane aspects of these processes, using the latest automatic image recognition technology, while retaining key decision points necessary to create trusted results. The project has developed two complementary machine-learning tools to propose identifications based on images captured on site. One method relies on the shape of the fracture outline of a sherd; the other is based on decorative features. For the outline-identification tool, a novel deeplearning architecture was employed, integrating shape information from points along the inner and outer surfaces. The decoration classifier is based on relatively standard architectures used in image recognition. In both cases, training the classifiers required tackling challenges that arise when working with real-world archaeological data: the paucity of labelled data; extreme imbalance between instances of the different categories; and the need to avoid neglecting rare types and to take note of minute distinguishing features of some forms. The scarcity of training data was overcome by using synthetically-produced virtual potsherds and by employing multiple data-augmentation techniques. A novel way of training loss allowed us to overcome the problems caused by under-populated classes and non-homogeneous distribution of discriminative features."	"j.jasrep.2020.102788.txt"

Using published and new isotope data from across western Europe, the author examines changing resource use from c. ad 350 to 1200. The geographical limits of millet and substantial marine consumption are identified and comparisons between childhood and adult diets made across regions. Cross-cultural interaction at a broad scale is emphasized and patterns within early medieval England form the subject of an in-depth case study. While doubt is cast onto the uptake of marine resource consumption in England following the Fish Event Horizon, changes in agricultural practices, the impact of Christianization, and the role of freshwater fish in diets are explored. The author's hierarchical meta-analytical approach enables identification of human-environment interactions, with significant implications for changing foodways in Europe during the first millennium ad."

In the Automated SEgmentation of Microtomography Imaging (ASEMI) project, we developed a tool to automatically segment these volumetric images, using manually segmented samples to tune and train a machine learning model. For a set of four specimens of ancient Egyptian animal mummies we achieve an overall accuracy of 94-98% when compared with manually segmented slices, approaching the results of off-the-shelf commercial software using deep learning (97-99%) at much lower complexity.

The geographical area where they are present is considerable, from the Aralo-Caspian zone to central-western Arabia. Always present, several elements make up the layout of the kites, which makes them singular constructions and identifies them. However, variations in shape or size are observed throughout their extension area. Using qualitative and quantitative variables obtained by observing a sample of kites (10% of the total identified) on high-resolution satellite images, we propose a combination of exploratory statistical analysis, unsupervised machine learning approaches (PCA, clustering and association rules) and spatial analysis (neighbourhood) to establish a clustering of kites based on their morphological descriptions. This work allows to identify groups of kites sharing similar features, each of which is relatively circumscribed in geographic space. This regionalisation of morphologically homogeneous groups of kites could explain the temporality of the constructions while, despite recent fieldwork, dating is still rare."

Biochar can provide additional agronomic benefits to cropping systems, including improved crop yield, soil water holding capacity, seed germination, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and soil pH. To maximize the beneficial effects of biochar amendments towards the inventory, increase, and management of SOC pools, nondestructive analytical methods such as ground penetrating radar (GPR) are needed to identify and quantify belowground C. The use of GPR has been well characterized across geological, archaeological, engineering, and military applications. While GPR has been predominantly utilized to detect relatively large objects such as rocks, tree roots, land mines, and peat soils, the objective of this study was to quantify comparatively smaller, particulate sources of SOC. This research used three materials as C sources: biochar, graphite, and activated C. The C sources were mixed with sand-12 treatments in total-and scanned under three moisture levels: 0%, 10%, and 20% to simulate different soil conditions. GPR attribute analyses and Naive Bayes predictive models were utilized in lieu of visualization methods because of the minute size of the C particles. Significant correlations between GPR attributes and both C content and moisture levels were detected. The accuracy of two predictive models using a Naive Bayes classifier for C content was trivial but the accuracy for C structure was 56%. The analyses confirmed the ability of GPR to identify differences in both C content and C structure. Beneficial future applications could focus on applying GPR across more diverse soil conditions."

Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) models constructed with device-specific portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) source catalogs benefit from the precision of individual pXRF machines and the ability of PLS-DA to handle highly correlated data sets to provide a source classification system that complements existing methods. Of the known obsidian sources in or near Southeast Alaska, four are identified in early Holocene archaeological assemblages: Obsidian Cove and Aguada Cove on Suemez Island, Mount Edziza in the Coast Mountain Range, and a newly identified source on Zim Creek, Kupreanof Island. A comprehensive reanalysis of early Holocene microblade cores (101 cores from 13 archaeological sites) across Southeast Alaska confirms the presence of exotic obsidian from Mount Edziza in one of the oldest sites, alongside possible evidence of landscape learning: testing of the obsidian source on Kupreanof Island. The dominance of the Obsidian Cove source for microblade core production supports hypotheses framing Northwest Coast microblade core morphology as an adaptation to the small nodules of raw material available at the source. A simple distance-decay model indicates no relationship between core reduction intensity and distance from the source, suggesting high forager mobility characterized by regular trips to Suemez Island (a voyage of up to 380 km) throughout the early Holocene."

The study of lithic assemblages collected at a deflation surface surrounded by stabilised sand dunes near the coastline, shows that wind produce significant corrasion (wind abrasion) of artefacts and affects preservation of small and medium size artefacts. The sample is mainly composed of chert knapping debitage with abraded and polished edges and surfaces. The artefact size distribution suggests that a subset of the assemblage exhibits good preservation, possibly due to the recent subaerial exposure. Furthermore, carbonate and mould coatings were recorded over the artefacts surface in contact with the ground, which indicates the presence of humid conditions in the sand dunes deflation area. In order to explore the factors that affected assemblage stability conditions in the locus, a machine learning based decision tree was applied. The model predicts and defines a threshold at which the occurrence of instability conditions may appear. Also, it suggests that relative altitude of artefacts within the deflation hollow is the primary variable explaining the exposure conditions recorded in the artefacts and it points out processes of differential deflation over time. The data presented here illustrates how wind alters local surface materials and emphasizes that a taphonomic perspective is needed to assess the formation processes within northern Patagonia coastal archaeological assemblages."

The interpretation of the GPR data usually involves a detailed and time-consuming analysis of large amounts of information, which entails nonnegligible chances of errors, especially under nonideal fieldwork conditions. The application of suitable automatic detection algorithms can be useful to more rapidly and successfully complete the interpretation task. In this work, we explore the use of supervised machine learning methodologies to automatically detect mud-wall signatures in radargrams and to map the structures from these detections. Several algorithms, based on Viola-Jones cascade classifiers and the image feature descriptors Haar, histogram of oriented gradients and local binary patterns, were implemented. These algorithms were applied to datasets previously acquired in pre-Inca and Inca-Hispanic sites located in the Andean NW region of Argentina. The best algorithms provided very good detection rates for well-preserved walls and acceptable rates for deteriorated walls, with a low number of spurious predictions. They also exhibited the ability to detect collapsed walls and fragments detached from them. These are remarkable results because mud walls are usually difficult to be detected by conventional analysis, owing to the complex and variable characteristics of their reflection patterns. The results of the automatic detection techniques were represented in plan views and three-dimensional (3D) views that delineated in detail most of the structures of the sites. These algorithms are very fast, so applying them significantly reduces the interpretation times. In addition, once they have been trained using the patterns of one or several sites, they are directly applicable to other sites with similar characteristics."	"arp.1799.txt"

These clouds usually comprise millions of unrelated points and are not presented in an efficient data structure, making them complicated to use. Furthermore, point clouds do not contain topological or semantic information on the elements they represent. Added to these difficulties is the fact that a variety of different kinds of sensors and measurement methods are used in study and documentation work: photogrammetry, LIDAR, etc. Each point cloud must be fused and integrated so that decisions can be taken based on the total information supplied by all the sensors used. A system must be devised to represent the discrete set of points in order to organise, structure and fuse the point clouds. In this work we propose the concept of multispectral voxels to fuse the point clouds, thus integrating multisensor information in an efficient data structure, and applied it to the real case of a building element in an archaeological context. The use of multispectral voxels for the fusion of point clouds integrates all the multisensor information in their structure.

The near exclusive consumption of these millets results in extremely elevated bulk collagen delta C-13 values (similar to-7 parts per thousand to -5 parts per thousand), which serve as natural isotopic tracers in palaeodiet studies. Here we report individual amino acid delta C-13 results (delta C-13(AA)) for humans (n = 12) and animals (n = 9) that consumed varying amounts of millets at the Proto-Shang period (2000-1600 BC) site of Nancheng, China. Using established delta C-13(AA) proxies (Delta C-13(Gly-Phe), Delta C-13(val-Phe), and plots of delta C-13(phe) vs. delta C-13(val), delta C-13(Lys) vs. Delta C-13(Giy-phe), and delta C-13(Lys) vs. Delta C-13(va1-phe)) and machine learning assisted principal component analysis (MLA-PCA), we compared the Nancheng data to published known archaeological C-3, C-4, marine and freshwater protein consumers. Exclusive millet-consuming humans and animals from Nancheng displayed highly C-13-enriched amino acid results, which were distinct from C-4 consumers of maize (Zea mays) in the Americas. Compared to delta C-13(AA) dietary proxies, MLA-PCA provides improved separation for all of the different dietary categories reviewed. Further, this method was able to distinguish additional dietary details, such as identifying brackish species. Increased application of MLA-PCA in palaeodiet research utilizing delta C-13(AA) measurements could create regional and global aminoisoscapes that can reveal unique dietary and environmental information that is otherwise hidden by bulk and existing delta C-13(AA) proxy isotopic analyses."

Aims. We search for new M 31 cluster candidates from the high-quality g- and i-band images of 21 245 632 sources obtained from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) through a CNN. Methods. We collected confirmed M 31 clusters and noncluster objects from the literature as our training sample. Accurate double-channel CNNs were constructed and trained using the training samples. We applied the CNN classification models to the PAndAS g-and i-band images of over 21 million sources to search new M 31 cluster candidates. The CNN predictions were finally checked by five experienced human inspectors to obtain high-confidence M 31 star cluster candidates. Results. After the inspection, we identified a catalogue of 117 new M 31 cluster candidates. Most of the new candidates are young clusters that are located in the M 31 disk. Their morphology, colours, and magnitudes are similar to those of the confirmed young disk clusters.

In contrast with traditional 2D and 3D shape matching approaches, we introduce a set of feature descriptors that are based on not only color and shape, but also normal maps. These are easy to acquire and combine high data quality with discriminability and robustness to some types of deterioration. Our feature descriptors range from general-purpose to domain-specific, and are quick to compute and match. We have tested our system on three datasets of fresco fragments, demonstrating that multi-cue matching using different subsets of features leads to different tradeoffs between efficiency and effectiveness. In particular, we show that normal-based features are more effective than color-based ones at similar computational complexity, and that 3D features are more discriminative than ones based on 2D or normals, but at higher computational cost. We also demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be used to effectively combine our new features with traditional ones. Our results show good retrieval performance, significantly improving upon the match prediction rate of state-of-the-art 3D matching algorithms, and are expected to extend to general matching problems in applications such as texture synthesis and forensics."

If left untreated, bronze disease can eat away at a bronze object until it is entirely deteriorated. The presence of copper trihydroxychlorides is indicative that this process is underway and therefore the detection of these corrosion products is necessary in guiding conservation of ancient bronze artefacts. In this paper we present a high spatial/spectral resolution short wave infrared (SWIR) imaging solution for mapping copper trihydroxychlorides in ancient bronze, combining hyperspectral imaging with an in-house developed unsupervised machine learning algorithm for automated spectral clustering. For this work, verification was obtained through use of an in-house developed reference database of typical ancient bronze corrosion products from several archaeological sites, and from collections of the National Museum of China. This paper also explores the suitability, and limitations, of a visible to near-infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral imaging system as a more accessible solution for mapping copper trihydroxychlorides associated with bronze disease.

We then document and appraise recent advances in analytical methods used to determine the major, minor, and trace elements of individual glass shards from tephra or cryptotephra deposits to aid their correlation and application. Protocols developed recently for the electron probe microanalysis of major elements in individual glass shards help to improve data quality and standardize reporting procedures. A narrow electron beam (diameter similar to 3-5 gm) can now be used to analyze smaller glass shards than previously attainable. Reliable analyses of 'microshards' (defined here as glass shards < 32 gm in diameter) using narrow beams are useful for fine-grained samples from distal or ultra-distal geographic locations, and for vesicular or microlite-rich glass shards or small melt inclusions. Caveats apply, however, in the microprobe analysis of very small microshards (<=similar to 5 gm in diameter), where particle geometry becomes important, and of microlite-rich glass shards where the potential problem of secondary fluorescence across phase boundaries needs to be recognised. Trace element analyses of individual glass shards using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), with crater diameters of 20 mu m and 10 mu m, are now effectively routine, giving detection limits well below 1 ppm. Smaller ablation craters (< 10 mu m) can be subject to significant element fractionation during analysis, but the systematic relationship of such fractionation with glass composition suggests that analyses for some elements at these resolutions may be quantifiable. In undertaking analyses, either by microprobe or LA-ICP-MS, reference material data acquired using the same procedure, and preferably from the same analytical session, should be presented alongside new analytical data. In part 2 of the review, we describe, critically assess, and recommend ways in which tephras or cryptotephras can be correlated (in conjunction with other information) using numerical or statistical analyses of compositional data. Statistical methods provide a less subjective means of dealing with analytical data pertaining to tephra components (usually glass or crystalsiphenocrysts) than heuristic alternatives. They enable a better understanding of relationships among the data from multiple viewpoints to be developed and help quantify the degree of uncertainty in establishing correlations. In common with other scientific hypothesis testing, it is easier to infer using such analysis that two or more tephras are different rather than the same. Adding stratigraphic, chronological, spatial, or palaeoenvironmental data (i.e. multiple criteria) is usually necessary and allows for more robust correlations to be made. A two-stage approach is useful, the first focussed on differences in the mean composition of samples, or their range, which can be visualised graphically via scatterplot matrices or bivariate plots coupled with the use of statistical tools such as distance measures, similarity coefficients, hierarchical cluster analysis (informed by distance measures or similarity or cophenetic coefficients), and principal components analysis (PCA). Some statistical methods (cluster analysis, discriminant analysis) are referred to as 'machine learning' in the computing literature. The second stage examines sample variance and the degree of compositional similarity so that sample equivalence or otherwise can be established on a statistical basis. This stage may involve discriminant function analysis (DFA), support vector machines (SVMs), canonical variates analysis (CVA), and ANOVA or MANOVA (or its two-sample special case, the Hotelling two-sample T-2 test). Randomization tests can be used where distributional assumptions such as multivariate normality underlying parametric tests are doubtful. Compositional data may be transformed and scaled before being subjected to multivariate statistical procedures including calculation of distance matrices, hierarchical cluster analysis, and PCA. Such transformations may make the assumption of multivariate normality more appropriate. A sequential procedure using Mahalanobis distance and the Hotelling two-sample T-2 test is illustrated using glass major element data from trachytic to phonolitic Kenyan tephras. All these methods require a broad range of high-quality compositional data which can be used to compare 'unknowns' with reference (training) sets that are sufficiently complete to account for all possible correlatives, including tephras with heterogeneous glasses that contain multiple compositional groups. Currently, incomplete databases are tending to limit correlation efficacy. The development of an open, online global database to facilitate progress towards integrated, high-quality tephrostratigraphic frameworks for different regions is encouraged. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

An important adaptive response to these conditions, of uncertain antiquity, has been the hand-excavation of a sequence of deep wells at key locations often along seasonal riverbeds and valley bottoms where subterranean aquifers can be tapped. Sophisticated indigenous water management systems have developed to ensure equitable access to these critical water resources, and these are part of well-defined customary institutional leadership structures that govern the community giving rise to a distinctive form of biocultural heritage. These systems, and the wells themselves, are increasingly under threat, however, from climate change, demographic growth, and socio-economic development. To contribute to an assessment of the scale, distribution and intensity of these threats, this study aimed to evaluate the land-use land-cover (LULC) and precipitation changes in this semi-arid to arid landscape and their association with, and impact on, the preservation of traditional wells. Multitemporal Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite imagery covering the period 1990 to 2020, analysed at a temporal resolution of 10 years, was classified using supervised classification via the Random Forest machine learning method to extract the following classes: bare land, grassland, shrub land, open forest, closed forest, croplands, settlement and waterbodies. Change detection was then applied to identify and quantify changes through time and landscape degradation indices were generated using the Shannon Diversity Index fragmentation index within a 15 km buffer of each well cluster. The results indicated that land cover change was mostly driven by increasing anthropogenic changes with resultant reduction in natural land cover classes. Furthermore, increased fragmentation has occurred within most of the selected buffer distances of the well clusters. The main drivers of change that have directly or indirectly impacted land degradation and the preservation of indigenous water management systems were identified through an analysis of land cover changes in the last 30 years, supporting insights from previous focused group discussions with communities in Kenya and Ethiopia. Our approach showed that remote sensing methods can be used for the spatially explicit mapping of landscape structure around the wells, and ultimately towards assessment of the preservation status of the indigenous wells."

The main principle of this monitoring process was the use of the seal impression as an 'indexical' sign, that is, as a means of identifying a seal-user who was acting in an authorising or securing role. Given the fact that seal-users could be acting on their own behalf or, alternatively, as representatives of an institution, there is uncertainty in the literature still over whether the seal impression stood for a single identifiable individual or not. In this paper, we present a new computational methodology for identifying and quantifying similarity within sets of multiple seal impressions made by the same seal. Using a combination of visualisations derived from computational analysis of 3-D scans, experimental work to make seal impressions, and scrutiny of the relevant sealing casts within the Corpus of Minoan and Mycenaean Seals, Heidelberg, we are able to identify groups of sealings impressed in significantly similar ways. We consider it probable that seal impressions with a high degree of similarity were made by the same individual or by two or more people trained to work in a very specific way. This computational methodology is transferable and would prove valuable for other collections of material with identifiable repeated visual elements, such as coins. The implications of our research and the nuance it adds to reconstructions of Neopalatial sealing practices are of broader relevance for sphragistic studies, and provide a point of comparison with the contemporary sealing material of the Ancient Near East."

Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has become a powerful technology to support various applications such as collecting real-time aquatic information, naval military applications, maritime security, natural disaster prediction and control, archaeological expeditions, oil and gas exploration, shipwrecks discovery, water contamination, marine life observation and smart Ocean. IoUT is referred as smart intricately linked underwater objects to monitor these underwater operations. The IoUT framework incorporates several underwater communication technologies based on magnetic induction, optical signals, radio signals and acoustic waves. It is an emerging communication ecosystem which can reveal a new era of research, business and naval applications. It is a novel and vibrant paradigm for the Blue Economy sector bringing the ability to communicate autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), sensing, actuating and transferring this data to control centers using regular internet speeds through low cost technologies. It is anticipated to support future networking systems which can bring tremendous improvement in previous generations in terms of stable networking, high coverage, massive connectivity, low latency, high data rate and low power consumption. This study introduces the possible network framework of IoUT which is naturally heterogeneous and must be flexible enough to work under unpredicted ocean conditions. In this study, we examine channel models, routing protocols, networking topologies and simulation tools. Furthermore, we discussed recent advancements in IoUT in terms of smart devices, consumer electronics, communication and role of AUVs. In addition, edge computing, optical wireless communication (OWC), data analytics, blockchain, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) and machine learning were viewed as promising techniques to support IoUT. We have dedicated a complete section to applications of IoUT. Finally, numerous open research challenges and future directions were presented. We believe this survey will be helpful to aggregate the research efforts and eliminate the technical uncertainties towards breakthrough novelties of IoUT."

Here we compile the largest dataset of past diet derived from stable isotope delta C-13 parts per thousand and delta N-15 parts per thousand values in the Americas to quantitatively evaluate the impact of 7000 years of climatic and demographic change on dietary variation in the Central Andes. Specifically, we couple paleoclimatic data from a general circulation model with estimates of relative past population inferred from archaeologically derived radiocarbon dates to assess the influence of climate and population on spatiotemporal dietary variation using an ensemble machine learning model capable of accounting for interactions among predictors. Results reveal that climate and population strongly predict diet (80% of delta 15N parts per thousand and 66% of delta 13C parts per thousand) and that Central Andean diets correlate much more strongly with local climatic conditions than regional population size, indicating that the past 7000 years of dietary change was influenced more by climatic than socio-demographic processes. Visually, the temporal pattern suggests decreasing dietary variation across elevation zones during the Late Horizon, raising the possibility that sociopolitical factors overrode the influence of local climatic conditions on diet during that time. The overall findings and approach establish a general framework for understanding the influence of local climate and demography on dietary change across human history."

The sampled layers were deposited during the Holocene, and provide evidence of riparian ecology in the region since the end of the last glacial interval. The samples were processed to extract sub-fossil macroremains (including seeds, fruits, and aquatic and terrestrial mollusc shells). Macrofossils are particularly useful for creating fine-resolution (site-specific) reconstructions. An innovative aspect of this study was the derivation of regional bioclimatic trends through time. This was achieved by applying a dual-layered weighted calibration function which incorporated the relative productivity of indicator taxa, their modelled climatic optima, and the influence of climate (temperature and precipitation) on their ecological niche. Optima and climatic influence values were calculated using the machine-learning maximum entropy environmental niche modelling tool, MAXENT, trained on global occurrence records for the taxa. This study aimed to address gaps in prior palaeoenvironmental research, allowing for a spatially explicit quantitative reconstruction of climate in the transitional foothill region near Calgary. Results indicated warm conditions immediately following glacial retreat, followed by an early to mid-Holocene cooling which coincided with the driest interval. Temperature and moisture regimes oscillated in the mid-Holocene, exhibiting the highest values for both parameters. Increased moisture was at least in part prompted by increased input from summer glacial meltwater (the result of higher summer temperatures) which added to the riparian water budget. The mid-to late Holocene, and up to modern times, showed a gradual decrease in both moisture and temperature, until stabilizing near the Holocene average."	"BOLTON_2017.txt"

While disciplinary discretions exist, researchers commonly devise spatial, temporal, and organizational scales in scoping phenomena of interest and determining measurements and representational frameworks in research design. The rise of the Fourth Paradigm for science drives data-intensive computing without preconceived notions regarding at what scale the phenomena or processes of interest operate, or at which level of details meaningful patterns may emerge. While scale is the a priori consideration for theory-driven research to seek ontological and relational affirmations, big data analytics and machine learning embed scale in algorithms and model outputs.

They demonstrate the importance of understanding the emergence and evolution of perceptual-motor coupling not only in complex motor skill learning. Stone toolmaking is a human motor skill which provides the earliest archeological evidence motor skill and social learning. Intentionally shaping a stone into a functional tool relies on the interaction of action observation and practice to support motor skill acquisition. The emergence of adaptive and efficient visuomotor processes during motor learning of such a novel motor skill requiring complex semantic understanding, like stone toolmaking, is not understood. Through the examination of eye movements and motor skill, the current study sought to evaluate the changes and relationship in perceptuomotor processes during motor learning and performance over 90 h of training. Participants' gaze and motor performance were assessed before, during and following training. Gaze patterns reveal a transition from initially high gaze variability during initial observation to lower gaze variability after training. Perceptual changes were strongly associated with motor performance improvements suggesting a coupling of perceptual and motor processes during motor learning."

For this purpose, we propose a four-stage algorithm which comprises three interacting deep neural networks and a watershed transform-based brick outline extraction step. At the beginning, a U-Net-based sub-network performs initial wall segmentation into brick, mortar and occluded regions, which is followed by a two-stage adversarial inpainting model. The first adversarial network predicts the schematic mortar-brick pattern of the occluded areas based on the observed wall structure, providing in itself valuable structural information for archeological and architectural applications. The second adversarial network predicts the pixels' color values yielding a realistic visual experience for the observer. Finally, using the neural network outputs as markers in a watershed-based segmentation process, we generate the accurate contours of the individual bricks, both in the originally visible and in the artificially inpainted wall regions. Note that while the first three stages implement a sequential pipeline, they interact through dependencies of their loss functions admitting the consideration of hidden feature dependencies between the different network components. For training and testing the network a new dataset has been created, and an extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation versus the state-of-the-art is given. The experiments confirmed that the proposed method outperforms the reference techniques both in terms of wall structure estimation and regarding the visual quality of the inpainting step, moreover it can be robustly used for various different masonry wall types."

Animals or structures they build (e.g. nests) can be photointerpreted from these images, however, automated detection is required for more efficient surveys. We developed semi-automated analyses to map white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster) nests in VHR aerial photographs of the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia, an important breeding site for many seabird species. Nest detection is complicated by high environmental heterogeneity at the scale of nests (similar to 1-2 m), the presence of many features that resemble nests and the variability of nest size, shape and context. Finally, the rarity of nests limits the availability of training data. These challenges are not unique to wildlife surveys and we show how they can be overcome by an innovative integration of object-based image analyses (OBIA) and the powerful machine learning one-class classifier Maxent. Maxent classifications using features characterizing object texture, geometry and neighborhood, along with limited object color information, successfully identified over 90% of high quality nests (most weathered and unusually shaped nests were also detected, but at a slightly lower rate) and labeled <2% of objects as candidate nests. Although this overestimates the occurrence of nests, the results can be visually screened to rule out all but the most likely nests in a process that is simpler and more efficient than manual photointerpretation of the full image. Our study shows that semi-automated image analyses for wildlife surveys are achievable. Furthermore, the developed strategies have broad relevance to image processing applications that seek to detect rare features differing only subtly from a heterogeneous background, including remote sensing of archeological remains. We also highlight solutions to maximize the use of imperfect or uncalibrated image data, such as some UAV-based imagery and the growing body of VHR imagery available in Google Earth and other virtual globes."

Yet, archaeological curricula have not always followed suit, and many archaeologists are not up-to-date with the necessary digital skills. To fill this gap, online tutorials and learning platforms are being developed to familiarize archaeologists and students with the potential of digital media for archaeological research practices. Given the essential pedagogical role of these platforms, their quality is deserving of deeper interrogation. Here, I review three major platforms offering tutorials on digital archaeology: the Programming Historian, Project MERCURY-SIMREC, and the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook. These are evaluated and compared based on their goals, design (intuitiveness, ease of use), accessibility (use of jargon, required prerequisite knowledge, software requirements), scope (target audience, range of skills addressed, targeted level of improvement), and efficiency (whether or not they achieve their intended goals). The review concludes with a road map contextualizing the current state of available resources in light of the wider state of digital archaeology, and it considers pathways toward future development."

The goal of this study is to propose a workflow to classify pottery surface treatments automatically, based on the extraction of images depicting surface geometry, calculated from 3D models. These images are then classified by Deep Learning. Three Convolutional Neural Network algorithms (VGG16 and VGG19 transfer learning, and a custom network) are quantitatively evaluated on an experimental dataset of 48 wheel-thrown vessels, created by a professional potter specifically for this study. To demonstrate workflow feasibility, six different surface treatments were applied to each vessel. Results obtained for all three classifiers (accuracy of 93 to 95%) surpass other state-of-the-art quantitative approaches proposed for pottery classification.

The study focuses on a specific kind of ancient painted pottery from the American Southwest, Tusayan White Ware, but we believe it has broader implications for a wide range of geographical settings and artifact types. Our results show that when properly trained, a deep learning model can assign types to digital images of decorated sherds with an accuracy comparable to, and sometimes higher than, four expert-level contemporary archaeologists. The technique also offers novel tools for visualizing both the importance of diagnostic design elements and overall design relationships between groups of pottery sherds. We demonstrate that this method can objectively match a specific unclassified sherd image to its most similar counterparts through a search of thousands of digital photos. This discovery has important archaeological implications for analyzing time relationships, monitoring stylistic trends, reconstructing fragmentary artifacts, identifying ancient artisans, and studying the evolution and spread of ancient technologies and styles. It also shows how deep learning models can potentially supplement or supplant traditional typologies in favor of more direct groupings and comparisons of artifacts."

A digital version of a mosaic can be useful for archaeologists, scholars and restorers who are interested in studying, comparing and preserving mosaics. Nowadays, archaeologists base their studies mainly on manual operation and visual observation that, although still fundamental, should be supported by an automatized procedure of information extraction. In this context, this research explains improvements which can change the manual and time-consuming procedure of mosaic tesserae drawing. More specifically, this paper analyses the advantages of using Mo.Se. (Mosaic Segmentation), an algorithm that exploits deep learning and image segmentation techniques; the methodology combines U-Net 3 Network with the Watershed algorithm. The final purpose is to define a workflow which establishes the steps to perform a robust segmentation and obtain a digital (vector) representation of a mosaic. The detailed approach is presented, and theoretical justifications are provided, building various connections with other models, thus making the workflow both theoretically valuable and practically scalable for medium or large datasets. The automatic segmentation process was tested with the high-resolution orthoimage of an ancient mosaic by following a close-range photogrammetry procedure. Our approach has been tested in the pavement of St. Stephen's Church in Umm ar-Rasas, a Jordan archaeological site, located 30 km southeast of the city of Madaba (Jordan). Experimental results show that this generalized framework yields good performances, obtaining higher accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Mo.Se. has been validated using publicly available datasets as a benchmark, demonstrating that the combination of learning-based methods with procedural ones enhances segmentation performance in terms of overall accuracy, which is almost 10% higher.

In the last few years, the usage of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) has eased the workload and risks of such interventions. To automate these tasks, the AUVs have to gather the information of their surroundings, interpret it and make decisions based on it. The two main perception modalities used at close range are laser and video. In this paper, we propose the usage of a deep neural network to recognise pipes and valves in multiple underwater scenarios, using 3D RGB point cloud information provided by a stereo camera. We generate a diverse and rich dataset for the network training and testing, assessing the effect of a broad selection of hyperparameters and values. Results show F1-scores of up to 97.2% for a test set containing images with similar characteristics to the training set and up to 89.3% for a secondary test set containing images taken at different environments and with distinct characteristics from the training set.

This community museum presents the deep history of human-environment interaction in the lower Belize River Watershed, which includes a wealth of ancient Maya sites and, as the birthplace of Creole culture, a rich repository of historical archaeology and oral history. The Creole are descendants of Europeans and enslaved Africans brought to Belize-a former British colony-for logging in the colonial period. Belizean history in schools focuses heavily on the ancient Maya, which is well documented archaeologically, but Creole history and culture remain largely undocumented and make up only a small component of the social studies curriculum. The development of a community archaeology museum in Crooked Tree aims to address this blind spot.

To reduce the number of false positives caused by specific regions in the research area, a novel approach has been developed and implemented called Location-Based Ranking. Experiments show that WODAN2.0 has a performance of circa 70% for barrows and Celtic fields on the small, non-random testing dataset, while the performance on the large, random testing dataset is lower: circa 50% for barrows, circa 46% for Celtic fields, and circa 18% for charcoal kilns. The results show that the introduction of Location-Based Ranking and bagging leads to an improvement in performance varying between 17% and 35%.

The increasing quantity of air and space-borne imagery available to archaeologists and the advances in computational science have created an emerging interest in automated archaeological detection. Traditional pattern recognition methods proved to have limited applicability for archaeological prospection, for a variety of reasons, including a high rate of false positives. Since 2012, however, a breakthrough has been made in the field of image recognition through deep learning. We have tested the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated remote sensing detection of archaeological features. Our case study is the qanat systems of the Erbil Plain in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The signature of the underground qanat systems on the remote sensing data are the semi-circular openings of their vertical shafts. We choose to focus on qanat shafts because they are promising targets for pattern recognition and because the richness and the extent of the qanat landscapes cannot be properly captured across vast territories without automated techniques.

A growing number of strategies for the three-dimensional (3D) acquisition and modelling of these invaluable assets have been developed in the last few years. Their objective is to efficiently respond to this documentation need and contribute to deepening the knowledge of the masterpieces investigated constantly by researchers operating in many fieldworks. Nowadays, one of the most effective solutions is represented by the development of image-based techniques, usually connected to a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetric approach. However, while images acquisition is relatively rapid, the processes connected to data processing are very time-consuming and require the operator's substantial manual involvement. Developing deep learning-based strategies can be an effective solution to enhance the automatism level. In this research, which has been carried out in the framework of the digitisation of a wooden maquettes collection stored in the `Museo Egizio di Torino', using a photogrammetric approach, an automatic masking strategy using deep learning techniques is proposed, to increase the level of automatism and therefore, optimise the photogrammetric pipeline. Starting from a manually annotated dataset, a neural network was trained to automatically perform a semantic classification to isolate the maquettes from the background. The proposed methodology allowed the researchers to obtain automatically segmented masks with a high degree of accuracy. The workflow is described (as regards acquisition strategies, dataset processing, and neural network training). In addition, the accuracy of the results is evaluated and discussed. Finally, the researchers proposed the possibility of performing a multiclass segmentation on the digital images to recognise different object categories in the images, as well as to define a semantic hierarchy to perform automatic classification of different elements in the acquired images."

This can be done through hypermedia and deep mapping as approaches to public archaeology. In twenty-first-century archaeology, scholars can rely on vastly improved technologies to aid them in these efforts toward public engagement, including digital photography, geographic information systems, and three-dimensional models. These technologies, even when collected for analysis or documentation, can be valuable tools for educating and involving the public with archaeological methods and how these methods help archaeologists learn about the past. Ultimately, academic storytelling can benefit from making archaeological results and methods accessible and engaging for stakeholders and the general public. ArcGIS StoryMaps is an effective tool for integrating digital datasets into an accessible framework that is suitable for interactive public engagement. This article describes the benefits of using ArcGIS StoryMaps for hypermedia and deep mapping-based public engagement using the story of copper production in Iron Age Faynan, Jordan, as a case study."

Traditional public outreach efforts for archaeological sites in shallow water typically focus on getting diving and snorkeling visitors to the site. Interpretive materials for such sites often include waterproof site plans, submerged markers, and guidelines to direct visitors around the site as they explore and learn. Deepwater archaeological sites present unique challenges, namely, the interpretation of resources managed for the public that the public will never physically visit. This article discusses FPAN's role in the Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project and the public education strategies developed to present the shipwreck and the extreme deepwater project to the public."

However, automated methods for mapping topographic features have remained a significant challenge. Deep learning (DL) mask regional-convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNN), which provides context-based instance mapping, offers the potential to overcome many of the difficulties of previous approaches to topographic mapping. We therefore explore the application of Mask R-CNN to extract valley fill faces (VFFs), which are a product of mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States. LiDAR-derived slopeshades are provided as the only predictor variable in the model. Model generalization is evaluated by mapping multiple study sites outside the training data region. A range of assessment methods, including precision, recall, and F1 score, all based on VFF counts, as well as area- and a fuzzy area-based user's and producer's accuracy, indicate that the model was successful in mapping VFFs in new geographic regions, using elevation data derived from different LiDAR sensors. Precision, recall, and F1-score values were above 0.85 using VFF counts while user's and producer's accuracy were above 0.75 and 0.85 when using the area- and fuzzy area-based methods, respectively, when averaged across all study areas characterized with LiDAR data. Due to the limited availability of LiDAR data until relatively recently, we also assessed how well the model generalizes to terrain data created using photogrammetric methods that characterize past terrain conditions. Unfortunately, the model was not sufficiently general to allow successful mapping of VFFs using photogrammetrically-derived slopeshades, as all assessment metrics were lower than 0.60; however, this may partially be attributed to the quality of the photogrammetric data. The overall results suggest that the combination of Mask R-CNN and LiDAR has great potential for mapping anthropogenic and natural landscape features. To realize this vision, however, research on the mapping of other topographic features is needed, as well as the development of large topographic training datasets including a variety of features for calibrating and testing new methods."

These approaches are generally tested in an (ideal) experimental setting but have not been applied in different contexts or 'in the wild', that is, incorporated in archaeological prospection. This research explores the applicability, knowledge discovery-on both a quantitative and qualitative level-and efficiency gain resulting from employing an automated detection tool called WODAN within (Dutch) archaeological practice. WODAN has been used to detect barrows and Celtic fields in LiDAR data from the Dutch Midden-Limburg area, which differs in archaeology, geo-(morpho)logy and land-use from the Veluwe in which it was developed. The results show that WODAN was able to detect potential barrows and Celtic fields, including previously unknown examples, and provided information about the structuring of the landscape in the past. Based on the results, combined human-computer strategies are argued, in which automated detection has a complementary, rather than a substitute role, to manual analysis. This can offset the inherent biases in manual analysis and deal with the problem that current automated detection methods only detect objects similar to the pre-defined target class(es). The incorporation of automated detection into archaeological prospection, in which the results of automated detection are used to highlight areas of interest and to enhance and add detail to existing archaeological predictive maps, seems logical and feasible."

However, manual inspection of ALS data is extremely time-consuming and as such presents a major bottleneck in the data analysis workflow. We have therefore set out to learn and test a deep neural network model for classifying from previously manually annotated ancient Maya structures of the Chactun archaeological site in Campeche, Mexico. We considered several variations of the VGG-19 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve the task of classifying visualized example structures from previously manually annotated ALS images of man-made aguadas, buildings and platforms, as well as images of surrounding terrain (four classes and over 12,000 anthropogenic structures). We investigated how various parameters impact model performance, using: (a) six different visualization blends, (b) two different edge buffer sizes, (c) additional data augmentation and (d) architectures with different numbers of untrainable, frozen layers at the beginning of the network. Many of the models learned under the different scenarios exceeded the overall classification accuracy of 95%. Using overall accuracy, terrain precision and recall (detection rate) per class of anthropogenic structure as criteria, we selected visualization with slope, sky-view factor and positive openness in separate bands; image samples with a two-pixels edge buffer; Keras data augmentation; and five frozen layers as the optimal combination of building blocks for learning our CNN model."

Among other evidence, this presence is attested by stone tools and associated cut-marks and other bone surface modifications (BSM), interpreted as the result of the consumption of animals by humans. Claims of an older human presence in the continent have been made based on the proposed anthropogenic modification of faunal remains; however, these have been controversial due to the highly subjective nature of the interpretations. Here, we employ advanced deep learning algorithms to objectively increase the accuracy of BSM identification on bones. With several models that exhibit BSM classification accuracies greater than 94%, we use ensemble learning techniques to robustly classify a selected sample of BSM from the approximately 30 kyr BP site of Arroyo del Vizcaino, Uruguay. Our results confidently show the presence of cut-marks imparted by stone tools on bones at the site. This result supports an earlier presence of humans in the American continent, expanding additional genetic and archaeological evidence of a human LGM and pre-LGM presence in the continent."

However, conventional methods rely heavily on visual interpretation by archaeologists and RS specialists, which are difficult to handle the large amount of archaeological traces in massive RS data. Especially for large-scale linear archaeological sites, such as the Great Wall, it is challenging to obtain systematic and complete identification results through human-computer interpretation. Based on the theory of deep learning, we propose an improved DeepLabv3+ model and conduct a typical application of the Great Wall of the Han dynasty (GWH) in northwest (NW) China using very high-resolution (VHR) aerial imagery. The main improvements of the DeepLabv3+ model were (1) replacing the encoder module with pre-trained ResNet101 to obtain deeper features, and (2) adding the Dice coefficient to the loss function to improve the accuracy under the unbalanced condition of positive and negative samples. The experimental evaluation reveals that the improved DeepLabv3+ model achieved accuracy of 98.37%, recall of 98.92%, F1 of 98.64%, and intersection over union (IoU) of 97.32%. Compared with the original model, accuracy, recall, F1, and IoU have improved by 9.03%, 9.13%, 9.08%, and 16.22%, respectively. Furthermore, the identification results in the test area also indicate that the improved model has good transferability. This study provides an automatic approach for surveying and mapping the GWH and indicates the great potential of deep learning in the identification of linear archaeological traces in RS archaeology."

Now that several taphonomic techniques allow identifying carnivore modification of bones, a next step involves determining carnivore type. This is of utmost importance to determine which carnivores were preying on and competing with hominins and what types of interaction existed among them during prehistory. Computer vision techniques using deep architectures of convolutional neural networks (CNN) have enabled significantly higher resolution in the identification of bone surface modifications (BSM) than previous methods. Here, we apply these techniques to test the hypothesis that different carnivores create specific BSM that can enable their identification. To make differentiation more challenging, we selected two types of carnivores (lions and jaguars) that belong to the same mammal family and have similar dental morphology. We hypothesize that if two similar carnivores can be identified by the BSM they imprint on bones, then two more distinctive carnivores (e.g. hyenids and felids) should be more easily distinguished. The CNN method used here shows that tooth scores from both types of felids can be successfully classified with an accuracy greater than 82%. The first hypothesis was successfully tested. The next step will be to differentiate diverse carnivore types involving a wider range of carnivore-made BSM. The present study demonstrates that resolution increases when combining two different disciplines (taphonomy and artificial intelligence computing) in order to test new hypotheses that could not be addressed with traditional taphonomic methods."

Most of the current convolutional neural network (CNN) object-oriented detection techniques are based on a faster region-based CNN (R-CNN) and other one-stage detectors that often lack adequate processing speeds and detection accuracies. Recently, the two-stage detector Mask R-CNN technique achieved impressive results in object detection and instance segmentation problems and was successfully applied in the analysis of archaeological airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. In this study, we outline a modified Mask R-CNN technique that reliably and efficiently detects relict charcoal hearth (RCH) sites on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data-based digital elevation models (DEMs). Using image augmentation and image preprocessing steps combined with the deep learning-based adaptive gradient method with a dynamic bound on the learning rate (AdaBound) optimization technique, we could improve the model's accuracy and significantly reduce its training time. We use DEMs based on high-resolution LiDAR data and the visualization for archaeological topography (VAT) technique that give images with a very strong contrast of the terrain and the outline of the sites of interest in the North German Lowland. Therefore, the model can identify RCH sites with an average recall of 83% and an average precision of 87%. Techniques such as the modified Mask R-CNN method outlined here will help to greatly improve our knowledge about archaeological site densities in the realm of historical charcoal production and past human-landscape interactions. This method provides an accurate, time-efficient and bias-free large-scale site mapping option not only for the North German Lowland but potentially for other landscapes as well."

Also, single models seem to work better than ensemble ones, and there is no optimal combination of hyperparameters that perform better in every possible scenario.

What might this mean for the profession of history, and for our training and institutional practices? How might it affect our research and interpretations of the past? Which fields of history will be most and least affected? I argue for a cautious embrace of the new data about the past coming from the paleosciences, offering a few examples of the promise and perils presented by the work of our natural science and archaeology colleagues. With each passing year, the proportion of our knowledge of the past that derives from the kinds of documents we have learned to read and interpret will shrink, and the proportion that derives from what to most of us are unfamiliar sciences will mount. This has implications. First, the deeper past might make a comeback. The last century or two are the best documented and will likely be least affected by the flood. The intellectual excitement may tip toward the study of earlier centuries where relative significance of information in other formats is greater. Second, the ways in which we train historians may need to change.

Here we use this novel method to assess the sedimentary conditions of two of the oldest Oldowan archaeofaunal records (DS and PTK, Bed I) from Olduvai Gorge Bed I in Tanzania. We show how the results support different diagenetic conditions for both penecontemporaneous sites, which are appropriate for their respective locations on the palaeolandscape to which they belonged. We also show how geochemical analyses of the clay deposit that embedded both sites indicate a similar soil pH divergence. PTK was formed on an alluvial sloping surface affected by rills but draining efficiently, which resulted in alkaline soil conditions, that optimised bone-surface preservation. DS occurred in a more depressed area that underwent intermittent flooding, affecting soil chemistry by creating more acidic conditions. This impacted on bone surfaces by dynamically modifying mark morphology. This deep-learning approach has relevance for the interpretation of the local palaeoecological conditions of both assemblages and their respective depositional loci. The results presented here open a new window to the incremental information gain through the use of artificial intelligence methods in taphonomic and palaeoecological research."

These areas function as temporary storage locations for stormwater when rivers cannot cope with the amount of water. A large area, the Onlanden - 2,500 hectares-was developed as such a storage area between 2008 and 2013. This peat area contains up to 300 medieval housing areas. These 'peatmounds', named after the current visible small mound, were explicitly mentioned as a preservation goal in the project. The preservation of the peatmounds during and after the project has been guaranteed by a combination of protective measures, research, and monitoring actions. At first a risk evaluation was performed, followed by a monitoring project focusing on the preservation of the organic part of the mounds. This evaluation showed that the rewetting of the mounds might improve the overall preservation. A total of fifteen monitoring stations were a-selectively distributed over the total area, covering the four main types of land use. The measured parameters at these stations focus on the desiccation/rewetting effects. The second threat, as determined in the risk evaluation, is the growth of deep penetrating plants. These roots might disturb the archaeological profile. Preventive coverage with plastic and up to a metre of soil could prevent root growth into the archaeology. An experimental coverage showed the effectiveness of this technique, but also the risks. This paper focuses on the lessons that can be learned from this six-year project, the monitoring results, and clearly shows the benefits of a combined approach in large-scale projects."

Automatic algorithms for image analysis have thus become an invaluable tool in medicine. Examples of this are two- and three-dimensional visualizations, image segmentation, and the registration of all anatomical structure and pathology types. In this context, we introduce Studierfenster (www.studierfenster.at): a free, non-commercial open science client-server framework for (bio-)medical image analysis. Studierfenster offers a wide range of capabilities, including the visualization of medical data (CT, MRI, etc.) in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) space in common web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge. Other functionalities are the calculation of medical metrics (dice score and Hausdorff distance), manual slice-by-slice outlining of structures in medical images, manual placing of (anatomical) landmarks in medical imaging data, visualization of medical data in virtual reality (VR), and a facial reconstruction and registration of medical data for augmented reality (AR). More sophisticated features include the automatic cranial implant design with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the inpainting of aortic dissections with a generative adversarial network, and a CNN for automatic aortic landmark detection in CT angiography images. A user study with medical and non-medical experts in medical image analysis was performed, to evaluate the usability and the manual functionalities of Studierfenster. When participants were asked about their overall impression of Studierfenster in an ISO standard (ISO-Norm) questionnaire, a mean of 6.3 out of 7.0 possible points were achieved. The evaluation also provided insights into the results achievable with Studierfenster in practice, by comparing these with two ground truth segmentations performed by a physician of the Medical University of Graz in Austria. In this contribution, we presented an online environment for (bio-)medical image analysis. In doing so, we established a client-server-based architecture, which is able to process medical data, especially 3D volumes. Our online environment is not limited to medical applications for humans. Rather, its underlying concept could be interesting for researchers from other fields, in applying the already existing functionalities or future additional implementations of further image processing applications. An example could be the processing of medical acquisitions like CT or MRI from animals [Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 84(4):448-456, 68], which get more and more common, as veterinary clinics and centers get more and more equipped with such imaging devices. Furthermore, applications in entirely non-medical research in which images/volumes need to be processed are also thinkable, such as those in optical measuring techniques, astronomy, or archaeology."

This article ponders this question by drawing on archaeological encounters with assemblages of drift matter (seaborne debris) in Norway and Iceland. Here, drift matter manifests evidence of both the relentlessly amassing material heritage of the Anthropocene and deep legacies of local engagement with this fluctuating resource. The tensions evoked along these coastlines therefore invite explorations of some of the challenges met in the current climate, problematizing conceptions of heritage and waste, wanteds and unwanteds, salvation and loss. Surely, drift matter is today largely perceived as not belonging in these natural environs. However, are there other thing lessons to be learned from taking seriously this heritage? Avoiding an interpretation of these things as out of context and a focus merely on what has been lost, this article asks whether it is possible that the sense of ambiguity, flux and drift emitted by this material may not only challenge but also enable alternative possibilities of knowing things - alternatives that may be of significance for a heritage in and of the Anthropocene."

Foremost, a protocol for the microCT scanning and virtual reconstruction of modern reference material and also of archaeological parenchyma is detailed. The protocol enables a 3D virtual representation of scanned materials to be recon-structed at high resolution (the highest resolution typically being between 2 and 3 mu m), which can be interro-gated qualitatively (user-defined) and quantitatively (using automated segmentation, algorithms and eventually deep learning neural networks) to enable taxonomic differentiation and comparability.

More precisely, to analyze a stock, archaeology, and surveillance, sev-eral cameras are installed underseas to collect videos. However, on the other hand, these large size videos require a lot of time and memory for their processing to extract relevant information. Hence, to automate this manual procedure of video assessment, an accurate and efficient automated system is a greater necessity. From this perspective, we intend to present a complete framework solution for the task of video summarization and object detection in underwater videos. We employed a perceived motion energy (PME) method to first extract the keyframes followed by an object detection model approach namely YoloV3 to perform object detection in underwater videos. The issues of blurriness and low contrast in underwater images are also taken into account in the presented approach by applying the image enhancement method. Furthermore, the suggested framework of underwater video summarization and object detection has been evaluated on a publicly available brackish dataset. It is observed that the proposed framework shows good performance and hence ultimately assists several marine researchers or scientists related to the field of underwater archaeology, stock assessment, and surveillance."

We address one type of completion which is producing a tentative completion of an aerial view of the remnants of a building structure. The inference process may start with as little as 10% of the structure and thus is fundamentally pluralistic (e.g., multiple completions are possible). We present a novel pluralistic building contour completion framework. A feature suggestion component uses an entropy-based model to request information from the user for the next most informative location in the image. Then, an image completion component trained using self-supervision and procedurally generated content produces a partial or full completion. In our synthetic and real-world experiments for archaeological sites in Turkey, with up to only 4 iterations, we complete building footprints having only 10-15% of the ancient structure initially visible. We also compare to various state-of-the-art methods and show our superior quantitative/qualitative performance.

Here, through the combined use of cross-validated logistic regression, mixed-effect regression models and computer vision deep learning methods, we approach the timing and modification rate of the microscopic variables that characterize cut marks. This study emphasizes the need to understand that bone surface modifications are dynamic taphonomic entities subjected to context-dependent morphing processes. Every depiction of a mark is just time-determined. Here, we show through experiments that trampling affected mostly the presence and internal configuration of microstriations, as well as the flaking and the morphology of the shoulder of the mark. The presence of overlapping striae and microabrasion were reported as signatures of trampling which did not affect cut mark morphology. Sandy sediment was found more abrasive than gravel sediment because of its potential to get inside the grooves of marks and modify their walls more intensively. The moderate abrasion process modeled here did not impact cut marks to the point of not being differentiated from other types of marks. A comparison with trampling marks successfully classified both types of modifications."	"Pizarro-Monzo et Dominguez-Rodrigo - 2020 - Dynamic modification of cut marks by trampling te.txt"

The potential of the site has been evaluated through multidisciplinary research including taxonomy, anatomy, deep learning, and direct dating of fossil remains. A surface study carried out in 2017, over a very limited area (2 m(2)) on the slope of one of the Ruidera lakes led to the discovery of more than 50 fossil specimens, including cranial (mainly teeth) and postcranial remains. This rich assemblage is dominated by the remains of Caprinae, although the presence of some small or medium carnivore remains also stands out. The identification of a cut mark, tested with Convolutional Neural Networks, suggests the presence of human activity within the bone assemblage. Several fossils were directly dated using a multi-technique approach involving radiocarbon, U-Th, and ESR methods. The results constrain the fossil assemblage to between 300 ka and 400 ka, positioning Los Villares as one of the first Middle Pleistocene localities identified in the Upper Guadiana basin, on the Southern edge of the Southern Iberian Plateau. These promising initial results show the great potential of the site to contribute to filling a gap of knowledge in the Pleistocene archaeo-paleontological record of the Iberian Peninsula. Nevertheless, we also acknowledge the need for systematic excavations in the future, not only to obtain a better idea of the lateral and stratigraphic extension of the fossil assemblage and its complete taxonomic composition, but also to confirm the human presence at the site."

Maps produced before the expansion of large-scale mechanized agriculture reflect a landscape that is lost today. Of particular interest to us is the great quantity of archaeologically relevant information that these maps recorded, both deliberately and incidentally. Despite the importance of the information they contain, researchers have only recently begun to automatically digitize and extract data from such maps as coherent information, rather than manually examine a raster image. However, these new approaches have focused on specific types of information that cannot be used directly for archaeological or heritage purposes. This paper provides a proof of concept of the application of deep learning techniques to extract archaeological information from historical maps in an automated manner. Early twentieth century colonial map series have been chosen, as they provide enough time depth to avoid many recent large-scale landscape modifications and cover very large areas (comprising several countries). The use of common symbology and conventions enhance the applicability of the method. The results show deep learning to be an efficient tool for the recovery of georeferenced, archaeologically relevant information that is represented as conventional signs, line-drawings and text in historical maps. The method can provide excellent results when an adequate training dataset has been gathered and is therefore at its best when applied to the large map series that can supply such information. The deep learning approaches described here open up the possibility to map sites and features across entire map series much more quickly and coherently than other available methods, opening up the potential to reconstruct archaeological landscapes at continental scales."

Cut mark analysis, however, has been the root of great debates, with some authors claiming to have the oldest cut marks in or outside of Africa. If these marks were to truly be anthropic in nature, then the repercussions of these findings would produce a paradigm shift for our understanding of human evolution. Unfortunately, the majority of methods available for cut mark classification are namely qualitative in nature. Here we provide a new, highly powerful artificially intelligent neural network classification model that can be used to quantitatively and more objectively overcome these issues, using 3D digital microscopy, Deep Learning and Geometric Morphometrics to obtain up to 100% accuracy in some cases. Abstract The concept of equifinality is currently one of the largest issues in taphonomy, frequently leading analysts to erroneously interpret the formation and functionality of archaeological and paleontological sites. An example of this equifinality can be found in the differentiation between anthropic cut marks and other traces on bone produced by natural agents, such as that of sedimentary abrasion and trampling. These issues are a key component in the understanding of early human evolution, yet frequently rely on qualitative features for their identification. Unfortunately, qualitative data is commonly susceptible to subjectivity, producing insecurity in research through analyst experience. The present study intends to confront these issues through a hybrid methodological approach. Here, we combine Geometric Morphometric data, 3D digital microscopy, and Deep Learning Neural Networks to provide a means of empirically classifying taphonomic traces on bone. Results obtained are able to reach over 95% classification, providing a possible means of overcoming taphonomic equifinality in the archaeological and paleontological register."

These amplitude maps are mainly used for data interpretation and provide a good insight into the subsurface but cannot fully describe it. The main limitations are discussed while studies aiming to overcome them are reviewed. These studies involve integrated interpretation approaches using both B-scans and C-scans, attribute analysis, fusion approaches, and recent attempts to automatically interpret C-scans using Deep Learning (DL) algorithms.

In contrast, in this study, we used an archaeological dataset with diverse underground structures. In the first step we used the deep learning network RetinaNet to detect hyperbola automatically and achieved an average precision of 0.58. In the next step, 10 different approaches for hyperbola fitting and thus velocity determination were applied. The derived information was validated with manually determined velocities and apex points. It was shown that hyperbola extraction by using a threshold and a column connection clustering (C3) algorithm followed by simple hyperbola fitting is the best method, which had a mean velocity error of 0.021 m/ns compared to manual determination.

Spatial interpretation of numerous objects with various shapes and sizes is a difficult challenge for archaeologists. Mapping structures with multiple elements whose area can exceed dozens of hectares, such as ancient agricultural field systems, is very time-consuming. These archaeological sites are composed of a large number of embanked fields, which together form a recognizable spatial pattern. Image classification and segmentation, as well as object recognition, are the most important tasks for deep learning neural networks (DLNN) and therefore they can be used for automatic recognition of archaeological monuments. In this study, a U-Net neural network was implemented to perform semantic segmentation of the ALS-derived data including (1) archaeological, (2) natural and (3) modern features in the Polish part of the Bialowieza Forest. The performance of the U-Net segmentation model was evaluated by measuring the pixel-wise similarity between ground truth and predicted segmentation masks.

One reflection of this is the carnivore modification of hominin bones. During human evolution, hominins were first prey and then predators of other animals, including carnivores. Modifications reported on some hominin bones could result from primary predators feeding on them or post-depositional modifications by scavengers. Determining carnivore agency would be crucial to interpret such information. Here, a series of computer vision models based on convolutional neural networks is presented, comparing five different types of carnivores jointly and then pairwise. It is shown how such models contain different heuristics regarding specific carnivore taxa, which regarding tooth marks made by lions and spotted hyenas can be accurately classified by as much as 92% of the testing set. The present study also shows the potential of transfer knowledge in building accurate classification of images and for taphonomic interpretation. The application to tooth marking on a 500 ka hominin femoral shaft indicates that by that time, carnivore modifications of human remains may have resulted from post-depositional scavenging rather than by predation."

Based on a deep-learning technique for post-mortem interval approach (ranging from 1 day up to 2000 years) an estimation of post-mortem interval with an accuracy of almost 100% in bones is possible. Estimating the post-mortem interval (PMI) of human skeletal remains is a critical issue of forensic analysis, with important limitations such as sample preparation and practicability. In this work, NIR spectroscopy (NIRONE (R) Sensor X; Spectral Engines, 61449, Germany) was applied to estimate the PMI of 104 human bone samples between 1 day and 2000 years. Reflectance data were repeatedly collected from eight independent spectrometers between 1950 and 1550 nm with a spectral resolution of 14 nm and a step size of 2 nm, each from the external and internal bone. An Artificial Neural Network was used to analyze the 66,560 distinct diagnostic spectra, and clearly distinguished between forensic and archaeological bone material: the classification accuracies for PMIs of 0-2 weeks, 2 weeks-6 months, 6 months-1 year, 1 year-10 years, and >100 years were 0.90, 0.94, 0.94, 0.93, and 1.00, respectively. PMI of archaeological bones could be determined with an accuracy of 100%, demonstrating the adequate predictive performance of the model. Applying a handheld NIR spectrometer to estimate the PMI of human skeletal remains is rapid and extends the repertoire of forensic analyses as a distinct, novel approach."

Deep neural models have been able to perform image-to-image translation by transferring pictorial styles, coloring old photographs or filling in missing parts. This last technique is known as image inpainting and enables restoration of damaged or missing parts of an image or photograph to obtain the complete picture. However, it is not always possible to properly define which parts are missing or to identify where they are missing, as in the case of superimposing new information on an already complete image. In this paper, we propose the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs), a well-known deep learning model, for virtual inpainting restoration of artificial landscape images containing archaeological remains of Greek temples. The network identifies key features determined by the internal logic of the architectural style denoted by the ruins and adds the missing architectural elements to obtain an image of the restored building. Unlike other studies, it does not receive any information on which elements should be added or where. Virtual inpainting restoration is capable of representing a building's envelope but also integrates particular aspects of the building related to the architectural language used for its design. The restoration of the fundamental parts of the classical Greek order was consistent, and the results were evaluated with objective metrics and through a subjective survey between academics and architects.

Acquiring and tagging point clouds is more expensive and tedious labour than its image equivalent process. Point cloud online datasets contain few samples for Deep Learning or not always the desired classes This work focuses on minimizing the use of point cloud samples for neural network training in urban object classification. The method proposed is based on the conversion of point clouds to images (pc-images) because it enables: the use of Convolutional Neural Networks, the generation of several samples (images) per object (point clouds) by means of multi-view, and the combination of pc-images with images from online datasets (ImageNet and Google Images). The study is conducted with ten classes of objects extracted from two street point clouds from two different cities. The network selected for the job is the InceptionV3. The training set consists of 5000 online images with a variable percentage (0% to 10%) of pc-images. The validation and testing sets are composed exclusively of pc-images. Although the network trained only with online images reached 47% accuracy, the inclusion of a small percentage of pc-images in the training set improves the classification to 99.5% accuracy with 6% pc-images. The network is also applied at IQmulus & TerraMobilita Contest dataset and it allows the correct classification of elements with few samples."	"j.autcon.2019.103058.txt"

As it stands, healing ways of knowing that depend on medicinal plants, the Earth's elements, and knowledge of the stars are still intact. The Indigenous Xicana/o/xs who belong to many of the mobile tribes of Mesoamerica share a long genealogical history of cultivating and sustaining their Native American rituals, which was weakened in Mexico and the United States during various periods of colonization. This special edition essay sheds light on the story of Quetzalcoatl and the Venus Star as a familial place of Xicana/o/x belonging and practice. To do so, we rely on the archaeological interpretation of these two entities as one may get to know them through artifacts, monuments, and ethnographic accounts, of which some date to Mesoamerica's Formative period (1500-400 BC). Throughout this paper, ancestral medicine ways are shown to help cultivate positive health, learning, and community. Such cosmic knowledge is poorly understood, yet it may further culturally relevant education and the treatment of the rampant health disparities in communities of Mesoamerican ancestry living in the United States. The values of and insights into Indigenous Xicana/o/x knowledge and identity conclude this essay."	"Garcia et Marquez - 2021 - Cultivating Positive Health, Learning, and Communi.txt"

Furthermore, vision-based approaches can cause errors, considering the complex types of de-terioration that develop in different scales and forms in monuments. This problem can be solved effec-tively owing to computer vision algorithms, commonly used in different areas nowadays. This study aims to develop a model that automatically detects and maps deteriorations (biological colonization, contour scaling, crack, higher plant, impact damage, microkarst, missing part) and restoration interventions using the Mask R-CNN algorithm, which has recently come to the fore with its feature of recognizing small and large-sized objects. To this end, a total of 2460 images of Yazilikaya monuments in the Hattusa archeo-logical site, which is on the UNESCO heritage list, were gathered. In the training phase of the proposed method, it was trained in model 1 to distinguish deposit deterioration commonly observed on the surface of monuments from other anomalies. Other anomalies trained were model 2. In this phase of the models, the average precision values with high accuracy rates ranging from 89.624% to 100% were obtained for the deterioration classes. The developed algorithms were tested on 4 different rock reliefs in Yazilikaya, which were not used in the training phase. In addition, an image of the Eflatunpinar water monument, which is on the UNESCO tentative list, was used to test the model's universality. According to the test results, it was determined that the models could be successfully applied to obtain maps of deterioration and restoration interventions in monuments in different regions.

The objective is to create automated methods for automatically classifying and successively retrieving photographic data leveraging the current breed of AI methods based on Deep Learning paradigm. In this work, the lack of images to be used for the training of the AI system is addressed by testing an approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for automatically synthesizing unrealistic photos, which, in turn, can be used for training image classification and retrieval systems. Specifically, we propose a method to drive the generation of realistic classical order images using GAN approaches anchored to semantic ontology domain representation. More specifically, the proposed AI leverages the advantages of knowledge-based and data-driven methods and foresees a level image generation: the first one that synthesizes isolated objects corresponding to each ontology concept and the second one that, instead, combines the generated objects according to the spatial information provided by the ontology in order to generate realistic scenes. The resulting images can then be employed to train automated classifiers and more reliable retrieval methods by minimizing the efforts usually required by human operators to manually annotate data. In addition, the proposed generative strategy allows for a deeper understanding of cultural heritage visual data enabling the possibility to enhance design capabilities in simulation contexts."

Studying butchery informs archaeological inferences about lithic artefact function and site formation and describes skeletal traces of carcass consumption, which may corroborate the butchery function of certain tools. Diverse methodologies including subjective personal observations and well-controlled experiments that investigate abstracted slicing mechanics or realistic butchery scenarios provide mixed conclusions about which kinds of tools are more efficient for butchery and whether their archaeological traces can be discriminated. Much less analytical attention is devoted to investigating whether a butcher's experience using stone tools to process carcasses impacts their performance, which may confound experimental assessment of how tool attributes are related to butchery efficiency. These experiments examine butchery performance in two novices over 40 goat forelimb and hindlimb trials where a single flake was used to deflesh and disarticulate a limb. By measuring butchery performance as defleshing efficiency (the amount of meat removed per second) and the time necessary to disarticulate limb elements, we demonstrate that in general, both butchers performed similarly when butchering forelimbs and hindlimbs and did not exhibit a strong learning curve of performance improvement. As well, flake weight, size, and cutting edge length were positively related to defleshing efficiency and negatively related to disarticulation time, suggesting that larger flakes are better butchery tools. Our results suggest that anatomical differences between forelimbs and hindlimbs did not impact butchery timing or efficiency and butchery performance is similar across novices. To maximize comparability of experimental butchery results, we encourage future research to examine butchery performance with respect to animal or tissue package size and investigate how butcher experience impacts performance."

We argue that, by focusing on the wider social context of rock art, such as the networks of relationships that images are embedded within and the powerful affective nature of motifs, researchers are better placed to examine rock art in a holistic sense while also considering notions of change, continuity, and relevance in relation to visual heritage."

Materials: 3232 well-preserved tubular bones representing an MNI of 250 human adults. Methods: Each bone was visually inspected. Measurements were taken with an osteometric board, sliding calipers, and a flexible tape measure. Results: Of 1210 metapodials excavated from eight burial contexts, ten were atypically short. Conclusions: The ten shortened elements represent an MNI of three individuals with brachydactyly from two tombs. The presence of at least two individuals with brachydactyly in one tomb adds support to a previous suggestion that tombs were used for familial interment. It is plausible that the third individual from a different tomb was related to the other two, and the different burial contexts may reflect postmarital practices. Significance: These cases offer insight into tomb use and underscore the importance of identifying rare developmental anomalies in the archaeological record as their presence may indicate genetic relationships within or among archaeological cemeteries. Limitations: With commingled contexts and incomplete recovery of skeletal remains, individualizing the brachydactylous elements was not possible. There is also a lack of comparative data from other Andean sites. Suggestions for Further Research: Identify more Andean cases of brachydactyly to learn if the relatively frequent involvement of the first digit is more common among Andean skeletal samples than North American, or if it is unique to Marcajirca."

Safeguarding heritage is also valued highly in the priorities of the European Commission. As a result, there have been several long-term initiatives involving the digitisation, annotation and cataloguing of tangible cultural heritage in museums and collections. Specifically, for built heritage, a pressing challenge is that historical monuments such as buildings, temples, churches or city fortification infrastructures are hard to document due to their historic palimpsest; spatial transformations, actions of destruction, reuse of material, or continuous urban development that covers traces and changes the formal integrity and identity of a cultural heritage site. The ability to reason about a monument's form is crucial for efficient documentation and cataloguing. This paper presents a 3D digitisation workflow through the involvement of reality capture technologies for the annotation and structure analysis of built heritage with the use of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) for classification purposes. The presented workflow contributes a new approach to the identification of a building's architectural components (e.g., arch, dome) and to the study of the stylistic influences (e.g., Gothic, Byzantine) of building parts. In doing so this workflow can assist in tracking a building's history, identifying its construction period and comparing it to other buildings of the same period. This process can contribute to educational and research activities, as well as facilitate the automated classification of datasets in digital repositories for scholarly research in digital humanities."

I analyze feminized artificial intelligence (Siri, Alexa, Cortana) in light of two science-fiction narratives: Tomorrow's Eve, a Victorian novel; and Her, a postmillennial film. Each story exemplifies a pivotal moment in media history: Eve the transition from symbolic to technical media; Her the transition from technical to computational media. Both stories depict a man falling in love with an artificially intelligent, feminized version of the communication media du jour. Whereas Eve and Her operate on our imaginary, Siri, Alexa, and Cortana are by our side every day, naturalizing contingent gender divisions. I address three questions: what is the cultural work accomplished by feminized AI? Which boundaries are coming down or built up? What gendered relations are (re)produced? Drawing on media archaeology, critical theory, gender studies, and media theory, this article argues the association of femininity with technology sustains differences across three dimensions: docile labour, replaceable embodiment, and artificial intelligence. This triadic framework weaves together analytic threads that often remain separate to develop a nuanced critique of femininity as a mode for domesticating new technology and technology as materializing gender relations. The discussion extends the framework to a more generalized analysis of AI as a problematic prescription for how we become machine-shaped. I advance an entangled reinterpretation of the Turing Test and suggest ethics, aesthetics, and performativity as key sites of intervention in rethinking AI design to include rather than exclude multiple forms of difference. The conclusion offers the framework as a novel heuristic for intersectional, nonreductive critiques of technology and difference."	"09502386.2019.1671469.txt"

An artificial intelligence approach"	"MEDITERRANEAN ARCHAEOLOGY & ARCHAEOMETRY"	"Why archaeological artefacts are the way they are? In this paper we try to solve such a question by investigating the relationship between form and function. We propose new ways of studying the way behaviour in the past can be asserted on the examination of archaeological observables in the present. In any case, we take into account that there are also non-visual features characterizing ancient objects and materials (i.e., compositional information based on mass spectrometry data, chronological information based on radioactive decay measurements, etc.). Information that should make us aware of many functional properties of objects is multidimensional in nature: size, which makes reference to height, length, depth, weight and mass; shape and form, which make reference to the geometry of contours and volumes; texture, which refers to the microtopography (roughness, waviness, and lay) and visual appearance (colour variations, brightness, reflectivity and transparency) of surfaces; and finally material, meaning the combining of distinct compositional elements and properties to form a whole. With the exception of material data, the other relevant aspects for functional reasoning have been traditionally described in rather ambiguous terms, without taking into account the advantages of quantitative measurements of shape/form, and texture. Reasoning about the functionality of archaeological objects recovered at the archaeological site requires a cross-disciplinary investigation, which may also range from recognition techniques used in computer vision and robotics to reasoning, representation, and learning methods in artificial intelligence. The approach we adopt here is to follow current computational theories of object perception to ameliorate the way archaeology can deal with the explanation of human behaviour in the past (function) from the analysis of visual and non-visual data, taking into account that visual appearances and even compositional characteristics only constrain the way an object may be used, but never fully determine it."

Using mathematical, physical, and artificial intelligence methods, some researchers in computational biology focused on uncovering the evolutionary ages of proteins according to present PPI networks (PINs), but improving their accuracy was challenging. A plausible explanation is that they solved biological problems with non-biological techniques and did not provide much attention to biological backgrounds and meanings of proteins or their relationships. In this paper, we propose two ways to improve the accuracy of age predicting and skillfully \embedding\\" multi source biological information in each iteration of an archaeology algorithm for yeast PIN. On the one hand, we reduce the probability of reversing errors by decreasing the non-duplication protein pairs, which are obtained from 460 gene trees constructed by means of a multiple sequence alignment and the neighbor joining algorithm. On the other hand, the reliable crossover standard from different biological information sources can decrease local random errors of alternative treatment. The application of the novel algorithm to simulation data and real yeast PINs shows a marked improvement in accuracy.

This article presents an archaeo-historic epidemiological modelling study of Rift Valley fever (RVF), using data-driven neural network technology. RVF affects both human and animal populations, can rapidly decimate herds causing catastrophic economic hardship, and is identified as a Category A biodefense pathogen by the US Center for Disease Control. Despite recent origins circa the early 1900s, little is known about the circumstances of its inception nor the relationships between factors that affect transmission. This evidence could be vital as the disease continues to expand from its epicentre in Kenya to other parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. RVF is a relevant case for archaeological/palaeopathological investigations of disease as it intersects between numerous human, animal, spatial, temporal, and sociopolitical dimensions. By integrating landscape archaeology, historical evidence, and climatic data, with evidence of human behaviour gathered through ethnoarchaeological study, this article presents an applied framework for human-animal palaeopathology. This framework aligns with the One Health approach that observes disease to be intrinsically tied to ecological and societal factors. We provide a useable alternative way of thinking about disease modelling in the present and the past, ultimately seeking to support efforts to accurately predict future impacts. Tapping into longitudinal evidence from the last 50-300 years offers a powerful way to respond to the threat zoonoses will pose to human populations around the world as the climate warms."

We try to develop an integrated system for archaeological 3D survey and all other types of archaeological data and knowledge by incorporating observable (material) and non-graphic (interpretive) data. Survey plays a central role, since it is both a metric representation of the archaeological site and, to a wider extent, an interpretation of it (being also a common basis for communication between the two teams). More specifically, 3D survey is crucial, allowing archaeologists to connect actual spatial assets to the stratigraphic formation processes (i.e., to the archaeological time) and to translate spatial observations into historical interpretation of the site. It is well known that laser scanner, photogrammetry and computer vision are very useful tools for archaeologists, although the integration of the representation of space, as well as archaeological time has not yet found a methodological standard of reference. We propose a common formalism for describing photogrammetric survey and archaeological knowledge stemming from ontologies: indeed, ontologies are fully used to model and store 3D data and archaeological knowledge. We equip this formalism with a qualitative representation of time, starting from archaeological stratigraphy. Stratigraphic analyses (both of excavated deposits and of upstanding structures) are closely related to Edward Cecil Harris's theory of the \Unit of Stratigraphication\\" (referred to as \\"US\\", while a stratigraphic unit of an upstanding structure Unita Stratigrafica Murale, in Italian, will be referred to as \\"USM\\"). Every US is connected to the others by geometric, topological and, eventually, temporal links, and these are recorded by the 3D photogrammetric survey. However, the limitations of the Harris matrix approach led us to use another formalism for representing stratigraphic relationships, namely Qualitative Constraints Networks (QCN), which was successfully used in the domain of knowledge representation and reasoning in artificial intelligence for representing temporal relations.\""	"Drap et al. - 2017 - Ontology-Based Photogrammetry Survey for Medieval .txt"

"ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE"	"Agent-based models (ABMs) are an increasingly popular tool in the social sciences. This trend seems likely to continue, so that they will become widely used in geography and in urban and regional planning. We present an overview of examples of these models in the life sciences, economics, planning, sociology, and archaeology. We conclude that ABMs strongly tend towards an individualist view of the social world. This point is reinforced by closer consideration of particular examples. This discussion pays attention to the inadequacy of an individualist model of society with reference to debates in social theory. We argue that because models are closed representations of an open world it is important that institutions and other social structures be explicitly included, or that their omission be explained. A tentative explanation for the bias of ABMs is offered, based on an examination of early research in artificial intelligence and distributed artificial intelligence from which disciplines the approach is derived. Some implications of these findings are discussed. We indicate some useful research directions which are beginning to tackle the individualism issue directly. We further note that the underlying assumptions of ABMs are often hidden in the implementation details. We conclude that such models must be subject to critical examination of their assumptions, and that model builders should engage with social theory if the approach is to realise its full potential."

Although used abundantly to justify our interest in ancient societies, this statement lacks practical meaning due to the high degree of uncertainty which cloaks archaeological studies and theories, and the fact that there is no real way to prove or validate them. That is why it is so important to approach this study from a multidisciplinary point of view, providing several inputs which complement each other and so maximize the amount of factual information drawn from the analysis. Even then, the study will never be truly complete because there will always be a missing document, a small trace of an object (Verhagen, 2008), that still needs to be analysed. This paper aims to be a useful contribution to historical research, specifically to the study of architectural history. Its purpose is to create a series of methods and tools for testing and analysing theories and hypotheses for historical scenarios (Vasaros, 2008) through the use of 3D modelling tools and Virtual Reality (VR) engines. The project was developed in two stages: The first was the creation of several three-dimensional (3D) models, each representing a different theory or hypothesis. The models were based on accurate Computer Assisted Design (CAD) (Autodesk (R) AutoCAD) models for the reconstruction of the buildings, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) (ESRI (R)) for the recreation of the terrain, thereby creating a realistic representation of what exists now, and a close approximation to what may have once existed. In the second stage, a simplified version of the models was imported into a Virtual Reality (VR) game engine (Bethesda Softworks (R)) to create the ambience of the villa at the time, allowing full exploration of the space. It also includes fauna and flora, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven avatars, as can be seen in the Video 1 provided in the electronic version of this manuscript. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This should lead researchers to the development of an integrated historical discourse maximizing the potential of interdisciplinary and fair research and minimizing the risks of bias."

The most controversial question of these algorithms is their poor performance on real world applications. To overcome such limitation this research work focuses on generating more efficient detectors through a more flexible boundary for self patterns. Rather than applying conventional affinity measures, the detectors are generated benefiting from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted on normal space. From the GMM capabilities the algorithm is able to dynamically determine efficient subsets of detectors. In order to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, different data sets have been examined as benchmark, including 2D synthesis data sets. Furthermore, for evaluating the capability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on real-world problems, it has been performed and tested for detecting anomalies in archaeological sites located in Lorestan, Iran. The experimental results prove how the proposed approach helps the negative selection algorithm to improve its detection capability, because the detectors can be efficiently distributed into the non-self space. It is important to note how this research work presents also a first analysis of the anomaly detection capabilities in the field of archaeology, introducing a novel application method, which can be efficiently used by the archaeologists for interpreting their growing amount of data and draw valuable conclusions about the historical past. Finally, in order to analyse the convergence and the running time of the proposed algorithm, a study has been conducted using the classical Time-To-Target plots, which present a standard graphical methodology for data analysis based on the comparisons between the empirical and theoretical distributions.

Design/methodology/approach Through an extensive literature review, this article maps out the current capabilities, challenges and limitations of NER and establishes the state of the art of the technique in the context of the early modern, digitally augmented research field. It also presents a new case study of NER research undertaken by Enlightenment Architectures: Sir Hans Sloane's Catalogues of his Collections (2016-2021), a Leverhulme funded research project and collaboration between the British Museum and University College London, with contributing expertise from the British Library and the Natural History Museum. Findings Currently, it is not possible to benchmark the capabilities of NER as applied to documents of the early modern period. The authors also draw attention to the situated nature of authority files, and current conceptualisations of NER, leading them to the conclusion that more robust reporting and critical analysis of NER approaches and findings is required. Research limitations/implications This article examines NER as applied to early modern textual sources, which are mostly studied by Humanists. As addressed in this article, detailed reporting of NER processes and outcomes is not necessarily valued by the disciplines of the Humanities, with the result that it can be difficult to locate relevant data and metrics in project outputs. The authors have tried to mitigate this by contacting projects discussed in this paper directly, to further verify the details they report here. Practical implications The authors suggest that a forum is needed where tools are evaluated according to community standards. Within the wider NER community, the MUC and ConLL corpora are used for such experimental set-ups and are accompanied by a conference series, and may be seen as a useful model for this. The ultimate nature of such a forum must be discussed with the whole research community of the early modern domain. Social implications NER is an algorithmic intervention that transforms data according to certain rules-, patterns- or training data and ultimately affects how the authors interpret the results. The creation, use and promotion of algorithmic technologies like NER is not a neutral process, and neither is their output A more critical understanding of the role and impact of NER on early modern documents and research and focalization of some of the data- and human-centric aspects of NER routines that are currently overlooked are called for in this paper. Originality/value This article presents a state of the art snapshot of NER, its applications and potential, in the context of early modern research. It also seeks to inform discussions about the kinds of resources, methods and directions that may be pursued to enrich the application of NER going forward. It draws attention to the situated nature of authority files, and current conceptualisations of NER, and concludes that more robust reporting of NER approaches and findings are urgently required.

To date, there are few solutions thoroughly tested in the field designed to perform this specific task, none of which operate autonomously. With a small, low-cost biomimetic platform known as the U-CAT, we developed a mapping-mission software architecture in which the vehicle executes three key sensor-based reactive stages: entering, exploring, and exiting. Encapsulated in the exploring stage are several state-defined navigation strategies, called patterns, which were designed and initially tested in simulation. The results of simulation work informed the selection of two patterns that were executed in field trials at a submerged building in Rummu Quarry Lake, Estonia, as part of several full mapping missions. Over the course of these trials, the vehicle was capable of observing the majority (78-97%) of 49.9 explorable square meters within 7 minutes. Based on these results, we demonstrate the capability of a low-cost and resource-constrained vehicle to perform confined space mapping under sensor uncertainty. Further, the observations made by the vehicle are shown to be suitable for a target site reconstruction and analysis in post-processing, which is the intended outcome of this type of mission in practical applications."

This study is devoted to rapidly reconstructing 3D personalized mandibles, especially when the mandible is severely damaged or totally lost. An example-oriented method based on principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reconstruct the 3D shapes of mandibles. The predictor variable is an input cranium, while the response variables is a full mandible. The linear relationship between the cranium and mandible is obtained based on a number of skull samples, which is used as prior knowledge. The PCA method reduces the dimensionality of the skull data to improve the accuracy and speed of the reconstruction process. Experiments are conducted based on 215 skull models in the Chinese craniofacial database established in the study of craniofacial morphology informatics at Beijing Normal University. In our experiments, parameters are modified to help improve the reconstruction results. The proposed method exhibits higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods according to comparison experiments results. Moreover, this method is robust to various types of input data and noise. Results indicate the proposed method is a fast and feasible tool for reconstructing 3D customized full mandibles."	"Yan et al. - 2022 - Example-oriented full mandible reconstruction base.txt"

However, it is difficult to correctly and directly measure the similarity between 3D skulls which are geometric models with multiple border holes and complex topologies. In this paper, based on the synthetic feature method, we propose a novel 3D skull descriptor, synthetic wave kernel distance distribution (SWKDD) constructed by the laplace-beltrami operator. By defining SWKDD, we obtain a concise global skull representation method and transform the complex 3D skull similarity measurement into a simple 1D vector similarity measurement. First, we give the definition and calculation of SWKDD and analyse its properties. Second, we represent a framework for 3D skull similarity measurement using the SWKDD of 3D skulls and details of the calculation steps involved. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method by calculating the similarity measurement of 3D skulls based on the real craniofacial database."

Ongoing research in underwater robotics intends to increase the autonomy of intervention operations that require physical interaction in order to achieve social benefits in fields such as archaeology or biology that cannot afford the expenses of costly underwater operations using remote operated vehicles. Autonomous grasping is still a very challenging skill, especially in underwater environments, with highly unstructured scenarios, limited availability of sensors and adverse conditions that affect the robot perception and control systems. To tackle these issues, we propose the use of vision and segmentation techniques that aim to improve the specification of grasping operations on underwater primitive shaped objects. Several sources of stereo information are used to gather 3D information in order to obtain a model of the object. Using a RANSAC segmentation algorithm, the model parameters are estimated and a set of feasible grasps are computed. This approach is validated in both simulated and real underwater scenarios."

Evidence from linguistics and archaeology indicates that the 'Austronesian expansion,' which began 4,000-5,000 years ago, likely had roots in Taiwan, but the ancestry of present-day Austronesian-speaking populations remains controversial. Here, we analyse genome-wide data from 56 populations using new methods for tracing ancestral gene flow, focusing primarily on Island Southeast Asia. We show that all sampled Austronesian groups harbour ancestry that is more closely related to aboriginal Taiwanese than to any present-day mainland population. Surprisingly, western Island Southeast Asian populations have also inherited ancestry from a source nested within the variation of present-day populations speaking Austro-Asiatic languages, which have historically been nearly exclusive to the mainland. Thus, either there was once a substantial Austro-Asiatic presence in Island Southeast Asia, or Austronesian speakers migrated to and through the mainland, admixing there before continuing to western Indonesia."

Its major challenges are the fact that 3D skulls are geometric models with multiple holes and complex topologies, there are facial expression changes on the 3D faces. Therefore, the general 3D shape similarity measurements, which are sensitive to boundaries and expression changes, make it impossible to simultaneously measure skull and face similarity. In this paper, we define a 3D signature to describe the pure intrinsic structure and distinguish the similar basic shape and complex topology of 3D skulls and faces: the harmonic wave kernel signature (HWKS). The HWKS is a point descriptor involving the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which is able to effectively extract geometrical and topological information from 3D skulls and faces. Based on the HWKS, we provide an effective pipeline for 3D skull and face similarity measurement by calculating the cosine distance between the HWKS values of 3D skulls and faces. By making comparisons with the wave kernel signature, the HWKS simultaneously describes both local and global properties of a shape. Results from a number of experiments have already shown that our framework is suitable for both measure 3D skull similarity and face similarity, and more importantly, measuring skull similarity and face similarity are two independent processes although using the same framework. By using the same measurement method for 3D skull similarity and face similarity, we observe an effective craniofacial relationship under unified metrics: The change rate of skull similarity is generally consistent with the corresponding face similarity, indicating the correlation between the shape of the 3D skull and its corresponding 3D face shape. And our experimental results show the rationality and effectiveness of this method, which refers to the previous researchers measure the similarity of the reconstructed face from the original skull to reflect the similarity of the original skull."

This is particularly true in the archaeological context where information concerning the discovery location of objects allows one to derive important relations between findings of a specific survey or even of different surveys, and time aspects extend from the excavation time, to the dating of archaeological objects. In recent years, several attempts have been performed to develop a spatio-temporal information system tailored for archaeological data.The first aim of this paper is to propose a model, called tar, for representing spatio-temporal data in archaeology. In particular, since in this domain dates are often subjective, estimated and imprecise, tar has to incorporate such vague representation by using fuzzy dates and fuzzy relationships among them. Moreover, besides to the topological relations, another kind of spatial relations is particularly useful in archeology: the stratigraphic ones. Therefore, this paper defines a set of rules for deriving temporal knowledge from the topological and stratigraphic relations existing between two findings. Finally, considering the process through which objects are usually manually dated by archeologists, some existing automatic reasoning techniques may be successfully applied to guide such process. For this purpose, the last contribution regards the translation of archaeological temporal data into a Fuzzy Temporal Constraint Network for checking the overall data consistency and reducing the vagueness of some dates based on their relationships with other ones."

But, still, some problems exist in the process of practical application, for example, when there are a large number of similar objects in the puzzle fragments, the error rate will reach 30%-50%. When some fragments are missing, most algorithms fail to restore the images accurately. When the number of fragments of the jigsaw puzzle is large, efficiency is reduced. During the intelligent puzzle, mainly the Sum of Squared Distance Scoring (SSD), Mahalanobis Gradient Compatibility (MGC) and other metrics are used to calculate the similarity between the fragments. On the basis of these two measures, we put forward some new methods: 1. MGC is one of the most effective measures, but using MGC to reassemble the puzzle can cause an error image every 30 or 50 times, so we combine the Jaccard and MGC metric measure to compute the similarity between the image fragments, and reassemble the puzzle with a greedy algorithm. This algorithm not only reduces the error rate, but can also maintain a high accuracy in the case of a large number of fragments of similar objects. 2. For the lack of fragmentation and low efficiency, this paper uses a new method of SSD measurement and mark matrix, it is general in the sense that it can handle puzzles of unknown size, with fragments of unknown orientation, and even puzzles with missing fragments. The algorithm does not require any preset conditions and is more practical in real life. Finally, experiments show that the algorithm proposed in this paper improves not only the accuracy but also the efficiency of the operation."	"S0218001418590012.txt"

The Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) has obtained precise photometry in 12 specially designed filters for large numbers of Galactic stars. Deriving their precise stellar atmospheric parameters and individual elemental abundances is crucial for studies of Galactic structure and the assembly history and chemical evolution of our Galaxy. Aims. Our goal is to estimate not only stellar parameters (effective temperature, T-eff, surface gravity, log g, and metallicity, [Fe/H]), but also [alpha/Fe] and four elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [N/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [Ca/Fe]) using data from the first data release (DR1) of J-PLUS. Methods. By combining recalibrated photometric data from J-PLUS DR1, Gaia DR2, and spectroscopic labels from the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, we designed and trained a set of cost-sensitive neural networks, the CSNet, to learn the nonlinear mapping from stellar colours to their labels. Special attention was paid to the poorly populated regions of the label space by giving different weights according to their density distribution. Results. We achieved precisions of delta T-eff similar to 55 K, delta log g similar to 0.15 dex, and delta [Fe/H] similar to 0.07 dex, respectively, over a wide range of temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities. The uncertainties of the abundance estimates for [alpha/Fe] and the four individual elements are in the 0.04-0.08 dex range. We compare our parameter and abundance estimates with those from other spectroscopic catalogs such as the Apache Point Observatory for Galactic Evolution Experiment and the Galactic Archaeology with High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph and find an overall good agreement. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate the potential of well-designed, high-quality photometric data for determinations of stellar parameters as well as individual elemental abundances. Applying the method to J-PLUS DR1, we obtained the aforementioned parameters for about two million stars, providing an outstanding dataset for chemo-dynamic analyses of the Milky Way. The catalog of the estimated parameters is publicly accessible."	"Yang et al. - 2022 - J-PLUS Stellar parameters, C, N, Mg, Ca, and [alp.txt"

Geostatistics allows producing these maps from a sample of locations by modelling the spatial autocorrelation structure of these kind of phenomena. However, the homogeneity of the prediction regions is a strong assumption in the model. The presence of barriers, such as the inner walls of domestic units, introduces discontinuities in prediction areas. In this paper, we investigate how to incorporate information of a geographical nature into the process of geostatistical prediction. We propose the use of cost-based distances to quantify the correlation between locations, a solution which has proved to be a practical alternative approach for archaeological intrasite analysis. The cost-based approach produces more reliable results avoiding the unrealistic assumption of the homogeneity of the study area. As a working example, a case study of the distribution of two specific chemical signatures in domestic floors is presented within a controlled ethnographical context in Northern Gujarat (India). On a broad disciplinary scale, the benefits of using our approach include improved estimates in regions with complex geometry and lower uncertainty in the kriging predictions. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

They are also unique in the ubiquitous adaptation to all biomes and habitats. From an evolutionary perspective, these trends seem to have started about two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of encephalization, the reduction of the dental apparatus, the adoption of a fully terrestrial lifestyle, resulting in the emergence of the modern anatomical bauplan, the focalization of certain activities in the landscape, the use of stone tools, and the exit from Africa. It is in this period that clear taphonomic evidence of a switch in diet with respect to Pliocene hominins occurred, with the adoption of carnivory. Until now, the degree of carnivorism in early humans remained controversial. A persistent hypothesis is that hominins acquired meat irregularly (potentially as fallback food) and opportunistically through klepto-foraging. Here, we test this hypothesis and show, in contrast, that the butchery practices of early Pleistocene hominins (unveiled through systematic study of the patterning and intensity of cut marks on their prey) could not have resulted from having frequent secondary access to carcasses. We provide evidence of hominin primary access to animal resources and emphasize the role that meat played in their diets, their ecology and their anatomical evolution, ultimately resulting in the ecologically unrestricted terrestrial adaptation of our species. This has major implications to the evolution of human physiology and potentially for the evolution of the human brain."

Next, we look at the method for introducing images into computer systems and look at how taxonomies order the foundational concepts that will determine how a system interprets the world. Then we turn to the question of labeling: how humans tell computers which words will relate to a given image. What is at stake in the way AI systems use these labels to classify humans, including by race, gender, emotions, ability, sexuality, and personality? Finally, we turn to the purposes that computer vision is meant to serve in our society-the judgments, choices, and consequences of providing computers with these capacities. Methodologically, we call this an archeology of datasets: studying the material layers of training images and labels, cataloguing the principles and values by which taxonomies are constructed, and analyzing how these taxonomies create the parameters of intelligibility for an AI system. By doing this, we can critically engage with the underlying politics and values of a system, and analyze which normative patterns of life are assumed, supported, and reproduced.\""	"Crawford et Paglen - Excavating AI the politics of images in machine l.txt"

The tools we use to approach archaeological research questions range from the trowel and brush to, more recently, even those of artificial intelligence. As access to computing technology has increased over time, the breadth of computer-assisted methods in archaeology has also increased. This proliferation has provided us a considerable toolset towards engaging both new and longstanding questions, especially as interdisciplinary collaboration between archaeologists, computer scientists, and engineers continues to grow. As an example of an archaeological project engaging in computer-based approaches, the Guadalupe/Colon Archaeological Project is presented as a case study. Project applications and methodologies range from the regional-scale identification of sites using a geographic information system (GIS) or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) down to the microscopic scale of classifying ceramic materials with convolutional neural networks. Methods relating to the 3D modeling of sites, features, and artifacts and the benefits therein are also explored. In this paper, an overview of the methods used by the project is covered, which includes 1) predictive modeling using a GIS slope analysis for the identification of possible site locations, 2) structure from motion (SfM) drone imagery for site mapping and characterization, 3) airborne LiDAR for site identification, mapping, and characterization, 4) 3D modeling of stone features for improved visualization, 5) 3D modeling of ceramic artifacts for more efficient documentation, and 6) the application of deep learning for automated classification of ceramic materials in thin section. These approaches are discussed and critically considered with the understanding that interdisciplinary cooperation between domain experts in engineering, computer science, and archaeology is an important means of improving and expanding upon digital methodologies in archaeology as a whole."

However, parameter calibration is insufficient to conduct data-driven explorations that are adequate in evaluating the importance of causal factors that constitute agent rules that match real-world individual-scale generative behaviors. We introduce evolutionary model discovery, a framework that combines genetic programming and random forest regression to evaluate the importance of a set of causal factors hypothesized to affect the individual's decision-making process. With evolutionary model discovery, we investigated the farm plot seeking behavior of the Ancestral Pueblo of the Long House Valley simulated in the Artificial Anasazi model. We evaluated the importance of causal factors unconsidered in the original model, which we hypothesized to have affected the decision-making process. Our findings, concur with other archaeological studies on the Ancestral Pueblo communities during the Pueblo II period, which indicate the existence of cross-village polities, hierarchical organization, and dependence on the viability of the agricultural niche. Contrary to the original Artificial Anasazi model, where closeness was the sole factor driving farm plot selection, selection of higher quality land, distancing from failed farm plots, and desire for social presence are found to be more important. Finally, models updated with farm selection strategies designed by incorporating these insights showed significant improvements in accuracy and robustness over the original Artificial Anasazi model."

Initially, they are neglected as all the archaeological wooden materials are, due to their perishable nature. Secondly, they are neglected since archaeologists tend to ignore them on their analysis as they are not final products or bigger structural elements. In this paper, it will be discussed the importance that even those materials can have regarding the wood procurement and elaboration processes, which will never be entirely studied without adding debris and formless pieces of wood into the equation. Based on the archaeological example of the waterlogged Neolithic site of la Draga (Banyoles, Spain), it will be discussed the way in which wood as raw material is obtained and transported to the settlement, and the ways the elaboration process is realized."

From the first hominin groups, carnivores have played a fundamental role in the ecosystem. From this perspective, understanding the trophic pressure between hominins and carnivores can provide valuable insights into the context in which humans survived, interacted with their surroundings, and consequently evolved. While numerous techniques already exist for the detection of carnivore activity in archaeological and palaeontological sites, many of these techniques present important limitations. The present study builds on a number of advanced data science techniques to confront these issues, defining methods for the identification of the precise agents involved in carcass consumption and manipulation. For the purpose of this study, a large sample of 620 carnivore tooth pits is presented, including samples from bears, hyenas, jaguars, leopards, lions, wolves, foxes and African wild dogs. Using 3D modelling, geometric morphometrics, robust data modelling, and artificial intelligence algorithms, the present study obtains between 88 and 98% accuracy, with balanced overall evaluation metrics across all datasets. From this perspective, and when combined with other sources of taphonomic evidence, these results show that advanced data science techniques can be considered a valuable addition to the taphonomist's toolkit for the identification of precise carnivore agents via tooth pit morphology."

The assessment of the degree of \spatial hazard\\" or \\"susceptibility\\" was carried out by the spatial prediction regardless of the return time of the events. The evaluation model for the susceptibility presented in this paper is very focused on the use of innovative techniques of artificial intelligence such as Neural Network, Fuzzy Logic and Neuro-fuzzy Network. The method described in this paper is a novel technique based on a neuro-fuzzy system. It is able to train data like neural network and it is able to shape and control uncertain and complex systems like a fuzzy system. This methodology allows us to derive susceptibility maps of the study area. These data are obtained from thematic maps representing the parameters responsible for the instability of the slopes. The parameters used in the analysis are: plan curvature, elevation (DEM), angle and aspect of the slope, lithology, fracture density, kinematic hazard index of planar and wedge sliding and toppling. Moreover, this method is characterized by the network training which uses a training matrix, consisting of input and output training data, which determine the landslide susceptibility. The neuro-fuzzy method was integrated to a sensitivity analysis in order to overcome the uncertainty linked to the used membership functions. The method was compared to the landslide inventory map and was validated by applying three methods: a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis, a confusion matrix and a SCAI method. The developed neuro-fuzzy method showed a good performance in the determination of the landslide susceptibility map.\""	"Sdao et al. - 2013 - Landslide susceptibility assessment by using a neu.txt"

They are used to monitor and control the environment by organizing the acquired data at a central device. Constructing fully connected networks using low power consumption sensors, devices, and protocols is one of the main challenges facing wireless sensor networks, especially in places where it is difficult to establish wireless networks in a normal way, such as military areas, archaeological sites, agricultural districts, construction sites, and so on. This paper proposes an approach for constructing and extending Bi-Directional mesh networks using low power consumption technologies inside various indoors and outdoors architectures called \an adaptable Spider-Mesh topology\\". The use of ESP-NOW protocol as a communication technology added an advantage of longer communication distance versus a slight increase of consumed power. It provides 15 times longer distance compared to BLE protocol while consuming only twice as much power. Therefore, according to our theoretical and experimental comparisons, the proposed approach could provide higher network coverage while maintaining an acceptable level of power consumption.\""	"Labib et al. - 2021 - An efficient networking solution for extending and.txt"

Ancient Libraries showcase a significant variability of scale, monumentality, and design with the use of different architectural components, and researchers cannot identify them as easily as other building types. The grammar is in 2D and captures all the variability of libraries from the simpler forms of the Hellenistic period to the more monumental of the Roman period, creating a vast range of designs. The paper presents the grammar-generated plans of the known libraries based on the evidence in the archaeological record. A frequency analysis of the occurrence of the rules in the derivations ranks the different characteristics of libraries and the architectural forms with which they occur in the corpus, to determine the probability of specific rules and to interpret them as mandatory or optional. The contribution of this work is that the shape grammar summarizes the design principles of ancient libraries visually and helps establish the building type of the ancient library. The frequency analysis assists tremendously in the reconstruction of fragmentarily preserved ancient libraries by providing a system in the reconstruction of the missing parts, when ambiguity is involved."

This industry was defined based on the lithic assemblages recovered from Hagfet ed Dabba and the nearby Haua Fteah site. We studied the lithic material from Level VI of the Hagfet ed Dabba site, which was excavated by Prof. McBurney in 1949. The aim of the lithic production was to obtain blade/bladelets through bidirectional and unidirectional prismatic methods. Blanks are of two types: wide, non-curved and straight blade/bladelets and narrow and pointed blades/bladelets. The blanks were modified mostly into backed pieces/points and Chamfered pieces. We discuss the role and possible contacts of the Dabban in understanding the Later Stone Age in northern Africa and the Initial Upper Palaeolithic and Upper Palaeolithic in the Near East. Following the technological analysis of Level VI, we consider the Early Dabban as representing an independent and local industry of the Early Later Stone Age with possible influences from the Levantine IUP and Ahmarian industries. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of direct affiliation with any of them, and the industry indeed portrays its own specific characteristics."

Data-driven methods allowed us to uncover networks of genes distinguishing the three major systems of modern human personality and adaptability: emotional reactivity, self-control, and self-awareness. Now we have identified which of these genes are present in chimpanzees and Neanderthals. We replicated our findings in separate analyses of three high-coverage genomes of Neanderthals. We found that Neanderthals had nearly the same genes for emotional reactivity as chimpanzees, and they were intermediate between modern humans and chimpanzees in their numbers of genes for both self-control and self-awareness. 95% of the 267 genes we found only in modern humans were not protein-coding, including many long-non-coding RNAs in the self-awareness network. These genes may have arisen by positive selection for the characteristics of human well-being and behavioral modernity, including creativity, prosocial behavior, and healthy longevity. The genes that cluster in association with those found only in modern humans are over-expressed in brain regions involved in human self-awareness and creativity, including late-myelinating and phylogenetically recent regions of neocortex for autobiographical memory in frontal, parietal, and temporal regions, as well as related components of cortico-thalamo-ponto-cerebellar-cortical and cortico-striato-cortical loops. We conclude that modern humans have more than 200 unique non-protein-coding genes regulating co-expression of many more protein-coding genes in coordinated networks that underlie their capacities for self-awareness, creativity, prosocial behavior, and healthy longevity, which are not found in chimpanzees or Neanderthals."

"Knowledge and information systems"	"Diffusion through graphs can be used to model many real-world processes, such as the spread of diseases, social network memes, computer viruses, or water  contaminants. Often, a real-world diffusion cannot be directly observed while it  is occurring - perhaps it is not noticed until some time has passed, continuous  monitoring is too costly, or privacy concerns limit data access. This leads to  the need to reconstruct how the present state of the diffusion came to be from  partial diffusion data. Here, we tackle the problem of reconstructing a diffusion  history from one or more snapshots of the diffusion state. This ability can be  invaluable to learn when certain computer nodes are infected or which people are  the initial disease spreaders to control future diffusions. We formulate this  problem over discrete-time SEIRS-type diffusion models in terms of maximum  likelihood. We design methods that are based on submodularity and a novel  prize-collecting dominating-set vertex cover (PCDSVC) relaxation that can  identify likely diffusion steps with some provable performance guarantees. Our  methods are the first to be able to reconstruct complete diffusion histories  accurately in real and simulated situations. As a special case, they can also  identify the initial spreaders better than the existing methods for that problem.  Our results for both meme and contaminant diffusion show that the partial  diffusion data problem can be overcome with proper modeling and methods, and that  hidden temporal characteristics of diffusion can be predicted from limited data."

"PloS one"	"Over the last decade, biomedical 3D-imaging tools have gained widespread use in the analysis of prehistoric bone artefacts. While initial attempts to  characterise the major categories used in osseous industry (i.e. bone, antler,  and dentine/ivory) have been successful, the taxonomic determination of  prehistoric artefacts remains to be investigated. The distinction between  reindeer and red deer antler can be challenging, particularly in cases of  anthropic and/or taphonomic modifications. In addition to the range of  destructive physicochemical identification methods available (mass spectrometry,  isotopic ratio, and DNA analysis), X-ray micro-tomography (micro-CT) provides  convincing non-destructive 3D images and analyses. This paper presents the  experimental protocol (sample scans, image processing, and statistical analysis)  we have developed in order to identify modern and archaeological antler  collections (from Isturitz, France). This original method is based on bone  microstructure analysis combined with advanced statistical support vector machine  (SVM) classifiers. A combination of six microarchitecture biomarkers (bone volume  fraction, trabecular number, trabecular separation, trabecular thickness,  trabecular bone pattern factor, and structure model index) were screened using  micro-CT in order to characterise internal alveolar structure. Overall, reindeer  alveoli presented a tighter mesh than red deer alveoli, and statistical analysis  allowed us to distinguish archaeological antler by species with an accuracy of  96%, regardless of anatomical location on the antler. In conclusion, micro-CT  combined with SVM classifiers proves to be a promising additional non-destructive  method for antler identification, suitable for archaeological artefacts whose  degree of human modification and cultural heritage or scientific value has  previously made it impossible (tools, ornaments, etc.)."

"Evolution and dispersal of mitochondrial DNA haplogroup U5 in Northern Europe: insights from an unsupervised learning approach to phylogeography."	"BMC genomics"	"BACKGROUND: We combined an unsupervised learning methodology for analyzing mitogenome sequences with maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetics to make detailed  inferences about the evolution and diversification of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)  haplogroup U5, which appears at high frequencies in northern Europe. METHODS:  Haplogroup U5 mitogenome sequences were gathered from GenBank. The hierarchal  Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (hierBAPS) method was used to generate  groups of sequences that were then projected onto a rooted maximum likelihood  (ML) phylogenetic tree to visualize the pattern of clustering. The haplogroup  statuses of the individual sequences were assessed using Haplogrep2. RESULTS: A  total of 23 hierBAPS groups were identified, all of which corresponded to  subclades defined in Phylotree, v.17. The hierBAPS groups projected onto the ML  phylogeny accurately clustered all haplotypes belonging to a specific haplogroup  in accordance with Haplogrep2. By incorporating the geographic source of each  sequence and subclade age estimates into this framework, inferences about the  diversification of U5 mtDNAs were made. Haplogroup U5 has been present in  northern Europe since the Mesolithic, and spread in both eastern and western  directions, undergoing significant diversification within Scandinavia. A review  of historical and archeological evidence attests to some of the population  interactions contributing to this pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The hierBAPS algorithm  accurately grouped mitogenome sequences into subclades in a phylogenetically  robust manner. This analysis provided new insights into the phylogeographic  structure of haplogroup U5 diversity in northern Europe, revealing a detailed  perspective on the diversity of subclades in this region and their distribution  in Scandinavian populations."

"Journal of human evolution"	"The establishment of the Acheulean in Europe occurred after MIS 17, but it was after the harsh glaciation of MIS 12 and during the long interglacial of MIS 11  that human occupation of Western Europe became more sustained, with an increased  number of sites. Menez-Dregan I (Brittany, France) is one of the key sites in  Western Europe that dates from this threshold, with an alternating sequence of 16  occupation levels and four marine deposits, from MIS 12 to 8. The large lithic  assemblages of more than 154,000 artifacts from knapping (cores, flakes) and  shaping (macrotools and shaping flakes) show the varying use of raw materials and  activities at the site through the sequence. This work focuses on the study of  the handaxes and cleavers using technological and metrical methods with  multivariate analysis, in combination with geometric morphometrics, and places  these analyses within the context of other technological changes at the site.  Collectively, results show the persistent use through the sequence of the same  lithic raw materials and technologies, including fire use and the import of  glossy sandstone from 20 km away, but with variation in activities at the site.  These findings suggest that Menez-Dregan I shows the development of a specific  material culture that reflects the local resources and environment. Results  further indicate that the site shows the sustained hominin occupation of the  area, despite varying climate and environment, with strong traditions of social  learning that were maintained through flexibility of site use, deep understanding  of the local territory, and the innovation of new technologies, such as the use  of fire. Evidence from the site is placed within the wider context of Europe, and  contrasted with areas to the north, such as Britain, where hominin occupation was  more sporadic and driven by cyclical climate change."

"Bone research"	"Back pain is a common condition with a high social impact and represents a global health burden. Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) is one of the major causes of  back pain; no therapeutics are currently available to reverse this disease. The  impact of bone mineral density (BMD) on IVDD has been controversial, with some  studies suggesting osteoporosis as causative for IVDD and others suggesting it as  protective for IVDD. Functional studies to evaluate the influence of genetic  components of BMD in IVDD could highlight opportunities for drug development and  repurposing. By taking a holistic 3D approach, we established an aging zebrafish  model for spontaneous IVDD. Increased BMD in aging, detected by automated  computational analysis, is caused by bone deformities at the endplates. However,  aged zebrafish spines showed changes in bone morphology, microstructure, mineral  heterogeneity, and increased fragility that resembled osteoporosis. Elements of  the discs recapitulated IVDD symptoms found in humans: the intervertebral  ligament (equivalent to the annulus fibrosus) showed disorganized collagen fibers  and herniation, while the disc center (nucleus pulposus equivalent) showed  dehydration and cellular abnormalities. We manipulated BMD in young zebrafish by  mutating sp7 and cathepsin K, leading to low and high BMD, respectively.  Remarkably, we detected IVDD in both groups, demonstrating that low BMD does not  protect against IVDD, and we found a strong correlation between high BMD and  IVDD. Deep learning was applied to high-resolution synchrotron µCT image data to  analyze osteocyte 3D lacunar distribution and morphology, revealing a role of sp7  in controlling the osteocyte lacunar 3D profile. Our findings suggest potential  avenues through which bone quality can be targeted to identify beneficial  therapeutics for IVDD."

Alongside  changing patterns of raw material use and decreasing artefact sizes, changes in  artefact types are commonly employed to differentiate Middle Stone Age (MSA) and  Later Stone Age (LSA) assemblages. The current paper employs a quantitative  analytical framework based upon the use of neural networks to examine changing  constellations of technologies between MSA and LSA assemblages from eastern  Africa. Network ensembles were trained to differentiate LSA assemblages from  Marine Isotope Stage 3&4 MSA and Marine Isotope Stage 5 MSA assemblages based  upon the presence or absence of 16 technologies. Simulations were used to extract  significant indicator and contra-indicator technologies for each assemblage  class. The trained network ensembles classified over 94% of assemblages  correctly, and identified 7 key technologies that significantly distinguish  between assemblage classes.

"Journal of proteome research"	"Proteomic analyses are becoming more widely used in archeology not only due to the greater preservation of proteins in ancient specimens than DNA but also  because they can offer different information, particularly relating to  compositional preservation and potentially a means to estimate biological and  geological age. However, it remains unclear to what extent different burial  environments impact these aspects of proteome decay. Teeth have to date been much  less studied than bone but are ideal to explore how proteins decay with time due  to the negligible turnover that occurs in dentine relative to bone. We  investigated the proteome variability and deamidation levels of different  sections of molar teeth from archeological bovine mandibles as well as their  mandibular bone. We obtained a greater yield of proteins from the crown of the  teeth but did not find differences between the different molars analyzed within  each mandible. We also obtained the best variety of protein from a well-preserved  mandible that was not the youngest one in terms of chronological age, showing the  influence of the preservation conditions on the final proteomic outcome.  Intriguingly, we also noticed an increase in abundance levels of fetuin-A in  biologically younger mandibles as reported previously, but the opposite trend in  tooth dentine. Interestingly, we observed higher glutamine deamidation levels in  teeth from the geologically oldest mandible despite it being the biologically  youngest specimen, showing that the archeological age strongly impacts on the  level of deamidations observed, much more so than biological aging. This  indicates that the glutamine deamidation ratio of selected peptides may act as a  good predictor of the relative geochronological age of archeological specimens."	"acs.jproteome.7b00648.txt"

The exploitation of remote sensing data and their products have seen an increased use in recent years in the fields of archaeological science and cultural heritage. Different spatial and spectral analysis datasets have been applied to distinguish archaeological remains and detect changes in the landscape over time, and, in the last decade, archaeologists have adopted more thoroughly automated object detection approaches for potential sites. These approaches included, among others, object detection methods, such as those of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, as well as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep learning (DL) models using aerial and satellite images, airborne and spaceborne remote sensing (ASRS), multispectral, hyperspectral images, and active methods (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging radar (LiDAR)). Researchers also refer to the potential for archaeologists to explore such artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in various ways, such as identifying archaeological features and classifying them. Here, we present a review study related to the contributions of remote sensing (RS) and artificial intelligence in archaeology. However, a main question remains open in the field of research: the rate of positive contribution of remote sensing and artificial intelligence techniques in archaeological research. The scope of this study is to summarize the state of the art related to AI and RS for archaeological research and provide some further insights into the existing literature."

The intent is to provide specialists with a GUI-based tool that can apply annotation used for training for neural network models, enable training and development of segmentation models, and allow classification of imagery data to facilitate auto-discovery of features. The tool is generic and can be used for a variety of settings, although the tool was tested using datasets from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Iran, Iraq, and Jordan. Current outputs suggest that trained data are able to help identify ruined structures, that is, structures such as burials, exposed building ruins, and other surface features that are in some degraded state. Additionally, qanat(s), or ancient underground channels having surface access holes, and mounded sites, which have distinctive hill-shaped features, are also identified. Other classes are also possible, and the tool helps users make their own training-based approach and feature identification classes. To improve accuracy, we strongly urge greater publication of UAV imagery data by projects using open journal publications and public repositories. This is something done in other fields with UAV data and is now needed in heritage and archaeology. Our tool is provided as part of the outputs given."

The presence of trees and undergrowth makes the reconnaissance of archaeological features and remains very difficult, while the erosion, increased by slope, tends to adversely affect the microtopographical features of potential archaeological interest, thus making them hardly identifiable. For the purpose of our investigations, a UAV LiDAR survey has been carried out at Perticara (located in Basilicata southern Italy), an abandoned medieval village located in a geologically fragile area, characterized by complex topography, strong erosion, and a dense forest cover. All of these characteristics pose serious challenge issues and make this site particularly significant and attractive for the setting and testing of an optimal LiDAR-based approach to analyze hilly forested regions searching for subtle archaeological features. The LiDAR based investigations were based on three steps: (i) field data acquisition and data pre-processing, (ii) data post-processing, and (iii) semi-automatic feature extraction method based on machine learning and local statistics. The results obtained from the LiDAR based analyses successfully confirmed by the field survey) made it possible to identify the lost medieval village that represents an emblematic case of settlement abandoned during the crisis of the late Middle Ages that affected most regions in southern Italy."

Telluric artifacts, imperfect line lists, inexact continuum placement, and inflexible models frustrate the scientific promise of these information-rich data sets. Here we debut an interpretable machine-learning framework blase that addresses these and other challenges. The semiempirical approach can be viewed as \transfer learning\\"-first pretraining models on noise-free precomputed synthetic spectral models, then learning the corrections to line depths and widths from whole-spectrum fitting to an observed spectrum. The auto-differentiable model employs back-propagation, the fundamental algorithm empowering modern deep learning and neural networks. Here, however, the 40,000+ parameters symbolize physically interpretable line profile properties such as amplitude, width, location, and shape, plus radial velocity and rotational broadening. This hybrid data-/model-driven framework allows joint modeling of stellar and telluric lines simultaneously, a potentially transformative step forward for mitigating the deleterious telluric contamination in the near-infrared. The blase approach acts as both a deconvolution tool and semiempirical model. The general-purpose scaffolding may be extensible to many scientific applications, including precision radial velocities, Doppler imaging, chemical abundances for Galactic archeology, line veiling, magnetic fields, and remote sensing. Its sparse-matrix architecture and GPU acceleration make blase fast. The open-source PyTorch-based code blase includes tutorials, Application Programming Interface documentation, and more. We show how the tool fits into the existing Python spectroscopy ecosystem, demonstrate a range of astrophysical applications, and discuss limitations and future extensions.\""	"Gully-Santiago et Morley - 2022 - An Interpretable Machine-learning Framework for Mo.txt"

The research is based on the Joconde database maintained by the French Ministry of Culture that contains illustrated artwork records from main French public and private museums representing archeological objects, decorative arts, fine arts, historical and scientific documents, etc. The Joconde database includes semantic metadata that describes properties of the artworks and their content. The developed methods create a data pipeline that processes metadata, trains a Convolutional Neural Network image classification model, makes prediction for the entire collection and expands the metadata to be the base for the SPARQL search queries. We developed a set of such queries to identify noise and silence in the human annotations and to search image content with results ranked according to the relevance of the objects quantified by the prediction score provided by the deep learning model. We also developed methods to discover new contextual relationships between the concepts in the metadata by analyzing the contrast between the concepts' similarities in the Joconde's semantic model and other vocabularies and we tried to improve the model prediction scores based on the semantic relations.

The information database of archaeological sites of South- Eastern Altai was created based on literary sources, the authors' own field research. Schemes of distribution of archaeological sites according to some landscape features: absolute height; position in relation to watercourses; slopes; exposition; solar radiation intensity in June; Intensities of solar radiation for December was created on the basis of geoinformation analysis of the relief of the territory and the available archaeological data. The obtained statistical regularities of the distribution of archaeological sites in the landscapes of South-Eastern Altai were the basis for the creation and verification of the algorithm of a machine-learning model - a neural network. Based on the results, a forecast map of the location of archaeological sites was created. The greatest probability of discovering new archaeological objects could be provided by the following landscape parameters, no further than 500-600 m from the river with a slope steepness of up to 4 degrees, with high intensity and summer ( June) solar radiation and with an exposure of slopes: southern, south-eastern and western. Unexplored archaeological sites in South-East Altai are most likely located along river valleys in the middle and lower reaches, at the confluence of rivers, along the periphery of intermountain basins, or on wide flat areas of above-floodplain terraces of river valleys. The data obtained make it possible to assess the contribution of landscape features to the spatial distribution of religious buildings of ancient peoples and provide opportunities for the search for new archaeological sites."

This identification, based on phytolith wave pattern, is made using a pretrained VGG19 deep learning model. This approach has been tested in three key phytolith genera for the study of agricultural origins in Near East archaeology: Avena, Hordeum and Triticum. Also, this classification has been validated at species-level using Triticum boeoticum and dicoccoides images. Due to the diversity of microscopes, cameras and chemical treatments that can influence images of phytolith slides, three types of data augmentation techniques have been implemented: rotation of the images at 45-degree angles, random colour and brightness jittering, and random blur/sharpen. The implemented workflow has resulted in an overall accuracy of 93.68% for phytolith genera, improving previous attempts. The algorithm has also demonstrated its potential to automatize the classification of phytoliths species with an overall accuracy of 100%.

Valuable physical and chemical information can be obtained through scientific micro damage analysis of precious pottery, which plays a positive role in the protection of ceramics and archaeological research. In this study, LIBS spectroscopy combined with sequential backward selection-random forest regression (SBS-RFR) algorithm was proposed for simultaneous quantitative analysis of multi-elements in ceramic samples. Firstly, the experimental conditions for LIBS spectrum acquisition of ceramic samples were optimized, including delay time, laser pulse energy and cumulative times, and the characteristic emission lines of typical elements in LIBS spectra of ceramic samples were identified based on national institute of standards and technology (NIST) database. Four different spectral preprocessing methods are used to preprocess LIBS spectral data to find a better preprocessing method. And then, SBS algorithm is applied to eliminate irrelevant or redundant feature variables of LIBS spectrum. SBS-RFR calibration model is constructed based on the screened input variables to realize the rapid determination of multi-element content of ceramic samples. To further verify the prediction performance of the SBS-RFR calibration model, its prediction performance is compared with several other models. The results show that SBS-RFR model has better prediction performance than partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest regression (RFR), of which the R-2 values of prediction set are all over or close 0.98, and the RMSE values for Mg, Al, Ca and Fe are 0.3954%, 0.4627%, 0.2532% and 0.3791% respectively. This study shows that LIBS technology combined with SBS-RFR algorithm is a feasible method for the quantitative analysis of elements in ceramic samples."

A case study from central Italy"	"JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE"	"The need for a quantitative approach to the morphologic study of ceramics is becoming increasingly evident. Ceramics are the most common material in many archaeological sites and a huge amount of data has accumulated over time. This data can be handled by Machine Learning algorithms which are rapidly gaining popularity in archaeology. Although most approaches can be referred to classification tasks, in this contribution a particular type of Neural Network is proposed for feature extraction from archaeological ceramics. Through this proposed method it is possible to gain a numerical weighted representation of the pottery profile that can be used for multivariate analyses. The case study will focus on regionalisation processes in pottery production between the end of the 2nd millennium BC and the first half of the 1st millennium BC in central Tyrrhenian Italy, a period that saw major transformations in the cultural and socio-political structure of Ancient Italy. The results seem to confirm the regionalisation hypothesis and offer interesting insights into the quantitative study of archaeological ceramics."

Understanding the firing regimes of archaeological ceramics reveals clues about the history of technological developments, but current methods for determining firing history have limitations. We experimented with non-destructive micro-CT combined with 3D image analysis to collect data on 42 pore variables, hypothesizing that pore systems are affected by ceramic firing temperatures. Analysis of variance showed that 26 of the variables are significantly related to firing temperature. Total volume porosity (open and closed pores) goes down with increased firing temperature, as does the fraction of pores accessible to a surface. Maximum pore volume, maximum and standard deviation of pore surface area, and pore elongation measures all decrease with higher firing temperatures while shape factors indicating greater sphericity increase. Pore connectivity measures decrease with higher firing temperatures, and variation in pore and connection lengths increases. The highest fired ceramics have low connection tortuosity. Three-dimensional image analysis of micro-CT data can augment existing methods of archaeothermometry, and since many pore characteristics impact the functional properties of ceramics (density, durability, mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, permeability, and diffusion), firing temperature studies of pore systems can inform wider archaeological ceramics research."

Their peculiarities are due to their roles as both a technological objective and in the management of core convexities to retain its geometric properties during reduction. In Middle Paleolithic con-texts, these backed implements are commonly produced during Levallois and discoidal reduction sequences. Backed products from Levallois and discoidal reduction sequences often show common geometric and morphological features that complicate their attribution to one of these methods. This study examines the identification of experimentally produced discoidal and recurrent centripetal Levallois backed products (including all stages of reduction) based on their morphological features. 3D geometric morphometrics are employed to quantify morphological variability among the experimental sample. Dimensionality reduction though principal component analysis is combined with 11 machine learning models for the identification of knapping methods. A supported vector machine with polynomial kernel has been identified as the best model (with a general accuracy of 0.76 and an area under the curve [AUC] of 0.8).

In this respect, machine learning (ML) works similar to typology. ML approaches are often deployed because it is thought that they reduce biases. However, biases are introduced into the process at many points, e.g., feature selection. In a project applying ML to Scandinavian rock art data, it was noticed that the algorithm struggles with classifying certain motifs correctly. This contribution discusses the consistency in applying biases by ML in contrast to the inconsistency of human classification. It is argued that it is necessary to bring machines and humans into a meaningful dialogue attempting to understand why apparent \misclassifications \\" happen. This is important to inform us about the classification output, our biases, and the rock art data, which are in themself inconsistent, ambiguous, and biased because they are the outcomes of human creativity.

Predicting original flake mass allows for researchers to make estimations of remaining mass, lost mass, and other features. All these measures relate to the organization of lithic technology by past societies. The present work tests three different models to predict log of flake mass: multiple linear regression, random forest regression, and artificial neural networks (ANN). Estimations of flake mass were performed using the remaining features of flakes from an experimental assemblage. This assemblage was obtained by the expansion of a previous dataset through the inclusion of bigger flakes, allowing the analysis to account for the effects of sample size and value distribution. Correlation results show a large/strong relation between predictions and real outcome (r(2) = 0.78 in the best case). Comparison of the models affords insights into variable importance for predicting flake mass. Results show that (for the present dataset) multiple linear regression still stands as the best method for predicting log of flake weight. Additionally, transformation of predicted values from the multiple linear regression and true values to the linear scale reinforces the linear correlation above the 0.8 threshold."

However, manual labelling on low-quality monochromatic historical orthophotos for semantic segmentation (pixel-level classification) is particularly challenging and time consuming. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology for the automated extraction of very-high-resolution (VHR) multi-class LC maps from historical orthophotos under the absence of target-specific ground truth annotations. The methodology builds on recent evolutions in deep learning, leveraging domain adaptation and transfer learning. First, an unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation between a source domain (recent RGB image of high quality, annotations available) and the target domain (historical monochromatic image of low quality, no annotations available) is learned using a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN). Second, a state-of-the-art fully convolutional network (FCN) for semantic segmentation is pre-trained on a large annotated RGB earth observation (EO) dataset that is converted to the target domain using the I2I function. Third, the FCN is fine-tuned using self-annotated data on a recent RGB orthophoto of the study area under consideration, after conversion using again the I2I function. The methodology is tested on a new custom dataset: the 'Sagalassos historical land cover dataset', which consists of three historical monochromatic orthophotos (1971, 1981, 1992) and one recent RGB orthophoto (2015) of VHR (0.3-0.84 m GSD) all capturing the same greater area around Sagalassos archaeological site (Turkey), and corresponding manually created annotations (2.7 km(2) per orthophoto) distinguishing 14 different LC classes. Furthermore, a comprehensive overview of open-source annotated EO datasets for multiclass semantic segmentation is provided, based on which an appropriate pretraining dataset can be selected. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is effective, increasing the mean intersection over union by 27.2% when using domain adaptation, and by 13.0% when using domain pretraining, and that transferring weights from a model pretrained on a dataset closer to the target domain is preferred."

Additionally, the completion of their shape and volume is sometimes costly and occasionally requires a lot of manual work, in particular for exhibition purposes. As a first step, improving the geometry of the fragments could potentially help the archaeological conservators in the assembling process. In this direction, in this paper we propose an end-to-end hybrid approach (i.e. point clouds to benefit from the limited complexity and creating results in mesh benefiting from their visualization capabilities) for the digital auto-completion of fragmented archaeological artifacts with missing parts in combination with a novel self-supervised data augmentation scheme in order to address a significant limitation in the archaeological domain (i.e. limited available observations and absence of the complete object). Our approach uses only 5 fragments of a partly preserved archaeological object for training. As a first step, an object (i.e artifact fragment) in mesh representation is converted to point cloud, from which more fragments of the incomplete original object are artificially generated, with the help of 3D surfaces, to augment the dataset. This dataset is then passed in a GAN-based Cascaded refinement network for generating a complete output, which is, finally, converted back to a mesh. Our experiments showed that the proposed hybrid approach, can be successfully used to complete and restore the geometry of a partly preserved archaeological object without having ever seen the complete form of it. However, due to the complexity of the fragments, such methods in most cases cannot generate their fine decorative and surface details. (c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."

From the very beginning of photography, during the first half of 19th century, people were amazed by this new media that could record all aspects of a scene with great detail. Soon though, everybody started wondering why would such an impressive innovation fail to record colors? A process of trials and errors then started (induding the most successful and pioneer one, involving the use of potato starch, by Lu-miere brothers) aiming to add colors to photographs, till the consolidation of new systems (camera and film) capable to collect photographs directly in color. In the past, before and during this innovative approach, native black and white photographs were painted in the effort to give them life. Today, only few methods are available to convert a panchromatic image into a color one, and they need a number of steps and further development to work properly. The paper tries to present different methods to colorize native black and white photographs, based on available automatic or interactive Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning or Deep Learning) algorithms, on revised remote sensing procedures and on visual tricks, aiming at exploring the possible improvement in readability and interpreta-tion of photographed contests in the usual analytic process of photo-interpretation.

The methodology follows the main agreements of the European project MEPROCS and uses the software Skeleton-ID (TM). Based on MEPROCS standard, a final decision was provided within a scale, assigning a value in terms of strong, moderate, or limited support to the claim that the skull and the facial image belonged (or not) to the same person for each case. The problem of binary classification, positive/negative, with an identification rate for each participant was revealed. The results obtained in this study make the authors think that both the quality of the materials used and the previous experience of the analyst play a fundamental role when reaching conclusions using the CFS technique.\""	"Martos et al. - 2022 - Computer-aided craniofacial superimposition valida.txt"

"Insights in paediatric virology during the COVID-19 era (Review)."	"Medicine international"	"The present article provides an overview of the key messages of the topics discussed at the '7th Workshop on Paediatric Virology', which was organised  virtually on December 20, 2021 by the Institute of Paediatric Virology, located  on the Island of Euboea in Greece. The workshop's plenary lectures were on: i)  viral pandemics and epidemics in the ancient Mediterranean; ii) the impact of  obesity on the outcome of viral infections in children and adolescents; and iii)  COVID-19 and artificial intelligence. Despite the scarcity of evidence from  fossils and remnants, viruses have been recognised as significant causes of  several epidemics in the ancient Mediterranean. Paediatric obesity, a modifiable  critical health risk factor, has been shown to impact on the development,  progression and severity of viral infections. Thus, the prevention of paediatric  obesity should be included in formulating public health policies and  decision-making strategies against emerging global viral threats. During the  current COVID-19 pandemic, artificial intelligence has been used to facilitate  the identification, monitoring and prevention of SARS-CoV-2. In the future, it  will play a fundamental role in the surveillance of epidemic-prone infectious  diseases, in the repurposing of older therapies and in the design of novel  therapeutic agents against viral infections. The collaboration between different  medical specialties and other diverse scientific fields, including archaeology,  history, epidemiology, nutritional technologies, mathematics, computer  technology, engineering, medical law and ethics is essential for the successful  management of paediatric viral infections. The current COVID-19 pandemic has  underscored this need, which should be further encouraged in modern medical  education."
