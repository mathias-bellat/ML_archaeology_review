NDXJ4F8X;journalArticle;2006;"Menze, B.H.; Ur, J.A.; Sherratt, A.G.";Detection of Ancient Settlement Mounds;Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing;In the present study we demonstrate the value of the SRTM three arcsecond terrain model for a virtual survey of archae-ological sites: the detection and mapping of ancient settle-ment mounds in the Near East. These so-called “tells” are the result of millennia of occupation within the period from 8000–1000 BC, and form visible landmarks of the world’s first farming and urban communities. The SRTM model provides for the first time an opportunity to scan areas not yet surveyed archaeologically on a supra-regional scale and to pinpoint probable tell sites. In order to map these historic monuments for the purpose of settlement-study and conser-vation, we develop a machine learning classifier which identifies probable tell sites from the terrain model. In a test, point-like elevations of a characteristic tell shape, standing out for more than 5 to 6 m in the DEM were successfully detected (85/133 tells). False positives (327/(600*1200) pixels) were primarily due to natural elevations, resembling tells in height and size.;MENZE_2006.txt
KU5JELP5;journalArticle;2009;"Boon, Paul; van Der Maaten, Laurens; Paijmans, Hans; Postma, Eric; Lange, Guus";Digital Support for Archaeology;Interdisciplinary Science Reviews;We describe an interdisciplinary approach in which computer scientists develop techniques to support archaeology. In the Reading Images for the Cultural Heritage ( RICH) project, a variety of methods have been developed to support archaeologists in the visualization, categorization, and characterization of archaeological objects, such as medieval glass, coins, ceramics, and seeds. The methods are based on image processing and machine learning algorithms that are tailored to the task at hand. We describe the algorithms and illustrate their application on archaeological datasets. The virtues and pitfalls of the interdisciplinary approach to archaeology are discussed.;174327909x441108.txt
EIJYJ4R5;journalArticle;2014;"Hörr, Christian; Lindinger, Elisabeth; Brunnett, Guido";Machine Learning Based Typology Development in Archaeology;Acm Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage;Formalizing and objectifying the process of artefact classification is an old wish of many archaeologists. On the other hand, data mining in general and machine learning in particular have already inspired many disciplines to introduce new paradigms of data analysis and knowledge discovery. Hence, this article aims for reviving the Typological Debate by adapting approved methods from other fields of science to archaeological data. To this end, we extensively discuss the concept of similarity and assess the suitability of machine learning techniques for the purposes of classification and typology development. Our methodology covers all steps starting from unordered, unlabelled objects to the emergence of a consistent and reusable typology. The application of this process is exemplarily illustrated by classifying the vessels from a Late Bronze Age cemetery in Eastern Saxony. Despite the individual character of these vessels, we achieved class prediction rates of more than 95%. Such a success was only possible, because we permanently reconciled the output of the learning algorithms with our own expectations in order to identify and eliminate the systematic errors within the typology.;2533988.txt

Datasheets and pictures, stratigraphic data and 3D models, time and space mixed together: these are only a few of the categories a researcher has to deal with. New technologies may be able to help in this process and trying to solve research related problems needs innovative solutions. In this paper, we describe the whole process for the design and development of a prototype application that uses an Immersive Virtual Reality system to acces archaeological excavation 3D data through the Gesture Variation Follower (GVF) algorithm. This makes it possible to recognise which gesture is being performed and how it is performed. Archaeologists have participated actively in the design of the interface and the set of gestures used for triggering the different tasks. Interactive machine learning techniques have been used for the real time detection of the gestures. As a case study the agora of Segesta (Sicily, Italy) has been selected. Indeed, due to the complex architectural features and the still ongoing fieldwork activities, Segesta represents an ideal context where to test and develop a research approach integrating both traditional and more innovative tools and methods.;Albertini et al. - 2017 - DESIGNING NATURAL GESTURE INTERACTION FOR ARCHAEOL.txt
DAGPRZJN;journalArticle;2018;Jensen, Peter;Semantically Enhanced 3D: A Web-based Platform for Spatial Integration of Excavation Documentation at Alken Enge, Denmark;Journal of Field Archaeology;The photorealistic and geometrically accurate 3-dimensional representation of excavations, provided by image-based modeling, has the potential to transform the process of excavation documentation, making it easier to share observations with other researchers. Paradoxically, however, spatial representation lacks the ability to convey archaeological interpretations. By example of excavations in Alken Enge, Denmark, this paper explores how a web-based 3D platform is able to facilitate the collaborative exchange of 3D excavation content and how the integration of spatial and attribute data into one common event-based data model may be advantageous. This includes enhancing the semantic value of field-recorded 3D models by segmenting the geometry using various techniques, such as 3D projections and machine learning. Accordingly, the paper demonstrates a framework for interactive 3D models, which includes attributed classification based on segmented 3D content correlated with traditional raster, vector, and textual data, delivering a spatially integrated platform for collaborative research.;Jensen - 2018 - Semantically Enhanced 3D A Web-based Platform for.txt
NMD2WZGT;journalArticle;2018;"Guyot, Alexandre; Hubert-Moy, Laurence; Lorho, Thierry";Detecting Neolithic Burial Mounds from LiDAR-Derived Elevation Data Using a Multi-Scale Approach and Machine Learning Techniques;Remote Sensing;Airborne LiDAR technology is widely used in archaeology and over the past decade has emerged as an accurate tool to describe anthropomorphic landforms. Archaeological features are traditionally emphasised on a LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using multiple Visualisation Techniques (VTs), and occasionally aided by automated feature detection or classification techniques. Such an approach offers limited results when applied to heterogeneous structures (different sizes, morphologies), which is often the case for archaeological remains that have been altered throughout the ages. This study proposes to overcome these limitations by developing a multi-scale analysis of topographic position combined with supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). Rather than highlighting individual topographic anomalies, the multi-scalar approach allows archaeological features to be examined not only as individual objects, but within their broader spatial context. This innovative and straightforward method provides two levels of results: a composite image of topographic surface structure and a probability map of the presence of archaeological structures. The method was developed to detect and characterise megalithic funeral structures in the region of Carnac, the Bay of Quiberon, and the Gulf of Morbihan (France), which is currently considered for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List. As a result, known archaeological sites have successfully been geo-referenced with a greater accuracy than before (even when located under dense vegetation) and a ground-check confirmed the identification of a previously unknown Neolithic burial mound in the commune of Carnac.;Guyot et al. - 2018 - Detecting Neolithic Burial Mounds from LiDAR-Deriv.txt
JEYVP59G;journalArticle;2018;"Klassen, Sarah; Weed, Jonathan; Evans, Damian";Semi-supervised machine learning approaches for predicting the chronology of archaeological sites: A case study of temples from medieval Angkor, Cambodia;Plos One;"Archaeologists often need to date and group artifact types to discern typologies, chronologies, and classifications. For over a century, statisticians have been using classification and clustering techniques to infer patterns in data that can be defined by algorithms. In the case of archaeology, linear regression algorithms are often used to chronologically date features and sites, and pattern recognition is used to develop typologies and classifications. However, archaeological data is often expensive to collect, and analyses are often limited by poor sample sizes and datasets. Here we show that recent advances in computation allow archaeologists to use machine learning based on much of the same statistical theory to address more complex problems using increased computing power and larger and incomplete datasets. This paper approaches the problem of predicting the chronology of archaeological sites through a case study of medieval temples in Angkor, Cambodia. For this study, we have a large dataset of temples with known architectural elements and artifacts; however, less than ten percent of the sample of temples have known dates, and much of the attribute data is incomplete. Our results suggest that the algorithms can predict dates for temples from 821-1150 CE with a 49-66-year average absolute error. We find that this method surpasses traditional supervised and unsupervised statistical approaches for under-specified portions of the dataset and is a promising new method for anthropological inquiry.";Klassen et al. - 2018 - Semi-supervised machine learning approaches for pr.txt
GKVITELT;journalArticle;2019;"Stott, David; Kristiansen, Soren Munch; Sindbaek, Soren Michael";Searching for Viking Age Fortresses with Automatic Landscape Classification and Feature Detection;Remote Sensing;Across the world, cultural heritage is eradicated at an unprecedented rate by development, agriculture, and natural erosion. Remote sensing using airborne and satellite sensors is an essential tool for rapidly investigating human traces over large surfaces of our planet, but even large monumental structures may be visible as only faint indications on the surface. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of a machine learning approach using airborne laser scanning data to address a needle-in-a-haystack problem, which involves the search for remnants of Viking ring fortresses throughout Denmark. First ring detection was applied using the Hough circle transformations and template matching, which detected 202,048 circular features in Denmark. This was reduced to 199 candidate sites by using their geometric properties and the application of machine learning techniques to classify the cultural and topographic context of the features. Two of these near perfectly circular features are convincing candidates for Viking Age fortresses, and two are candidates for either glacial landscape features or simple meteor craters. Ground-truthing revealed the latter sites as ice age features, while the cultural heritage sites BorgO and Tr ae lbanke urge renewed archaeological investigation in the light of our findings. The fact that machine learning identifies compelling new candidate sites for ring fortresses demonstrates the power of the approach. Our automatic approach is applicable worldwide where digital terrain models are available to search for cultural heritage sites, geomorphological features, and meteor impact craters.;Stott et al. - 2019 - Searching for Viking Age Fortresses with Automatic.txt
ZYLSA4NP;journalArticle;2019;"Pargeter, Justin; Khreisheh, Nada; Stout, Dietrich";Understanding stone tool-making skill acquisition: Experimental methods and evolutionary implications;Journal of Human Evolution;Despite its theoretical importance, the process of stone tool-making skill acquisition remains understudied and poorly understood. The challenges and costs of skill learning constitute an oft-neglected factor in the evaluation of alternative adaptive strategies and a potential source of bias in cultural transmission. Similarly, theory and data indicate that the most salient neural and cognitive demands of stone tool-making should occur during learning rather than expert performance. Unfortunately, the behavioral complexity and extensive learning requirements that make stone knapping skill acquisition an interesting object of study are the very features that make it so challenging to investigate experimentally. Here we present results from a multidisciplinary study of Late Acheulean handaxe-making skill acquisition involving twenty-six naive participants and up to 90 hours training over several months, accompanied by a battery of psychometric, behavioral, and neuroimaging assessments. In this initial report, we derive a robust quantitative skill metric for the experimental handaxes using machine learning algorithms, reconstruct a group-level learning curve, and explore sources of individual variation in learning outcomes. Results identify particular cognitive targets of selection on the efficiency or reliability of tool-making skill acquisition, quantify learning costs, highlight the likely importance of social support, motivation, persistence, and self-control in knapping skill acquisition, and illustrate methods for reliably reconstructing ancient learning processes from archaeological evidence.

GM5WBJ3T;journalArticle;2019;"Benner, Jordan; Knudby, Anders; Nielsen, Julie; Krawchuk, Meg; Lertzman, Ken";Combining data from field surveys and archaeological records to predict the distribution of culturally important trees;Diversity and Distributions;Aim Indigenous communities involved in conservation planning require spatial datasets depicting the distribution of culturally important species. However, accessing datasets on the location of these species can be challenging, particularly when the current distribution no longer reflects areas with the full range of suitable growing conditions because of past logging. We test whether using occurrence data from community-based field surveys and archaeological records in species distribution models can help predict the distribution of monumental western redcedar trees (Thuja plicata)-large, high-quality trees suitable for cultural purposes such as carving dug-out canoes, totem poles and traditional houses. This species is critically important to indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest of North America, but trees suitable for traditional carving and building are diminishing in abundance due to logging. Location Our analysis covers the spatial extent of the traditional territory of the Heiltsuk First Nation, which encompasses a portion of the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, Canada. Methods We built and compared species distribution models using the machine learning program, Maxent, based on occurrence data from field surveys and archaeological records of culturally modified trees. Results Our findings highlight similarities and differences between the predictions from these species distribution models. When validating these models against occurrences from an independent dataset, the archaeological record model performs better than the field survey model. These findings may arise because the independent dataset was collected on an unlogged island-an environment that aligns more closely with the historic forest conditions revealed by the archaeological records than the current distribution revealed by the field surveys. Main conclusions We demonstrate and discuss the utility of using archaeological data in species distribution modelling and conservation planning when the target species is associated with shifting environmental baselines, data limitations and an important cultural resource.;ddi.12947.txt
PDKSCRIJ;journalArticle;2019;"Vandati, Ali R.; Weissmann, John David; Timmermann, Axel; de Leon, Marcia S. Ponce; Zollikofer, Christoph P. E.";Drivers of Late Pleistocene human survival and dispersal: an agent-based modeling and machine learning approach;Quaternary Science Reviews;Understanding Late Pleistocene human dispersals from Africa requires understanding a multifaceted problem with factors varying in space and time, such as climate, ecology, human behavior, and population dynamics. To understand how these factors interact to affect human survival and dispersal, we have developed a realistic agent-based model that includes geographic features, climate change, and time-varying vegetation and food resources. To enhance computational efficiency, we further apply machine learning algorithms. Our approach is new in that it is designed to systematically evaluate a large-scale agent-based model, and identify its key parameters and sensitivities. Results show that parameter interactions are the major source in generating variability in human dispersal and survival/extinction scenarios. In realistic scenarios with geographical features and time-evolving climatic conditions, random fluctuations become a major source of variability in arrival times and success. Furthermore, parameter settings as different as 92% of maximum possible difference, and occupying more than 30% of parameter space can result in similar dispersal scenarios. This suggests that historical contingency (similar causes - different effects) and equifinality (different causes - similar effects) are primary constituents of human dispersal scenarios. While paleoanthropology, archaeology and paleogenetics now provide insights into patterns of human dispersals at an unprecedented level of detail, elucidating the causes underlying these patterns remains a major challenge.

U96FK6VW;journalArticle;2019;"Orengo, H. A.; Garcia-Molsosa, A.";A brave new world for archaeological survey: Automated machine learning-based potsherd detection using high-resolution drone imagery;Journal of Archaeological Science;Archaeological pedestrian survey is one of the most popular techniques available for primary detection of archaeological sites and description of past landscape use. As such it is an essential tool not just for the understanding of past human distribution, economy, demography and so on but also for cultural heritage management and protection. The most common type of pedestrian surface survey consists of fieldwalking relatively large tracts of land, recording the dispersion of items of material culture, predominantly pottery fragments, by teams of archaeologists and students. This paper presents the first proof of concept for the automated recording of material culture dispersion across large areas using high resolution drone imagery, photogrammetry and a combination of machine learning and geospatial analysis that can be run using the Google Earth Engine geospatial cloud computing platform. The results show the potential of this technique, under appropriate field circumstances, to produce accurate distribution maps of individual potsherds opening a new horizon for the application of archaeological survey. The paper also discusses current limitations and future developments of this method.;Orengo et Garcia-Molsosa - 2019 - A brave new world for archaeological survey Autom.txt
SZC9LX36;journalArticle;2020;Ramazzotti, Marco;Modeling the past. Logics, semantics and neural computing in archaeology;Archeologia E Calcolatori;The study of complex archaeological systems through the new Artificial Intelligence and Natural and Neural Computing is a research project which evaluates the historical meaning of the relationships between records of the past as an essentially human construction. It repeats a strong position of Analytical Archaeology, but updates it on the basis of the progress which neurosciences and physics have made in simulating the principles which regulate memory, orientation, classification and mapping of reality. Modelling and simulating the contexts of the past in integrated, parallel, distributed processing through machine learning methods, must make use of a precise encoding of the documents. It takes on an important role in empirical research only when the results produced become the hyper-surface of a network membrane to continue, update, refine or open the analysis itself. After some 30 years of such theoretical, analytical and experimental research, logics, semantics and applications of neural computing maintain their distinct value as a new theoretical approach for the study of dynamic and systemic cultural complexity. They provide a new analytical paradigm for computational modelling in archaeology and an advanced computational method for pattern recognition in archaeometry.;RAMAZZOTTI_2020.txt
FPL3LL2G;journalArticle;2020;"Hansen, Jered; Nebel, Mark";Prioritizing Archaeological Inventory and Protection with Predictive Probability Models at Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, USA;Kiva-Journal of Southwestern Anthropology and History;To prioritize archaeological site inventory and protection at Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (Glen Canyon NRA), predictive probability models were developed using the Random Forests machine learning method. Glen Canyon NRA consists of approximately 5,000 km 2 in Arizona and Utah containing evidence of multiple prehistoric cultures spanning at least 10000 years. Large portions of Glen Canyon NRA have never been inventoried for archaeological resources. Archaeological sites are potentially subject to irreparable damage along roads and receding Lake Powell shorelines accessible to off-road vehicles and boats. The diverse cultural history, highly variable physiographic environments, archaeological site data inconsistencies, and limited available model variable data provided challenges. Model results improved by classifying sites, based on their inferred usage, and distinguishing distinct physiographic regions within the larger NRA landscape. Model results are being used to target ongoing field surveys. Initial validation is positive, with new sites discovered in areas of predicted high probability.;Hanse_Nebel_2020.txt

While challenges involved in spatially correcting these unusual panoramic film images has long served as a stumbling block to researchers, an online tool called \Sunspot\"" now offers a straightforward process for efficient and accurate orthorectification of CORONA, helping to unlock the potential of this historical imagery for global-scale archaeological prospection. With these new opportunities come significant new challenges in how best to search through large imagery datasets like that offered by CORONA. In contrast to currently popular trends in archaeological remote sensing that seek to employ either automated, machine learning-based approaches, or alternatively, crowd-sourced approaches to assist in the identification of ancient sites and features, this paper argues for systematic, intensive, and expert-led \""brute force\"" methods. Results from a project that has sought to map all sites and related features across a large study in the northern Fertile Crescent illustrate how an expert-led analysis may be the best means of generating nuanced, contextual understandings of complex archaeological landscapes.""";00934690.2020.1713285.txt
JBZY5PFP;journalArticle;2020;"Davis, Dylan S.; Douglass, Kristina";Aerial and Spaceborne Remote Sensing in African Archaeology: A Review of Current Research and Potential Future Avenues;African Archaeological Review;Africa represents a vast region where remote sensing technologies have been largely uneven in their archaeological applications. With impending climate-related risks such as increased coastal erosion and rising sea levels, coupled with rapid urban development, gaps in our knowledge of the human history of this continent are in jeopardy of becoming permanent. Spaceborne and aerial remote sensing instruments are powerful tools for producing relatively complete records of archaeological settlement patterns and human behavior at landscape scales. These sensors allow for massive amounts of information to be recorded and analyzed in short spans of time and offer an effective means to increase survey areas and the discovery of new cultural deposits. In this paper, we review various case studies throughout Africa dealing with aerial and satellite remote sensing applications to landscape archaeology in order to highlight recent developments and future research avenues. Specifically, we argue that (semi)automated remote sensing methods stemming from machine learning developments will prove vital to expanding our knowledge base of Africa's archaeological record. This is especially important for coastal and island regions of the continent where climate change threatens the survival of much of the archaeological record.;s10437-020-09373-y.txt

However, the un-monitored deployment of UAVs called the amateur drones (AmDr) can lead to serious security threats and risk to human life and infrastructure. Therefore, timely detection of the AmDr is essential for the protection and security of sensitive organizations, human life and other vital infrastructure. AmDrs can be detected using different techniques based on sound, video, thermal, and radio frequencies. However, the performance of these techniques is limited in sever atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we propose an efficient un-supervise machine learning approach of independent component analysis (ICA) to detect various acoustic signals i.e., sounds of bird, airplanes, thunderstorm, rain, wind and the UAVs in practical scenario. After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), the power spectral density (PSD) and the Root Mean Square Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM)and K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)to detect the presence or absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a single or multiple AmDrs at a time in the presence of multiple acoustic interfering signals. The proposed technique is verified through extensive simulations and it is observed that the RMS values of PSD with KNN performs better than the MFCC with KNN and SVM.;Uddin et al. - 2020 - Amateur Drones Detection A machine learning appro.txt

Several different machine learning algorithms for binary pixel classification (i.e. stone vs non-stone) were evaluated. Input features were extracted from high-resolution orthomosaics and digital elevation models (both derived from aerial imaging). Comparative analysis used two colour spaces (RGB and HSV), texture features (contrast, homogeneity and entropy raster maps), and the topographic position index, combined with nine supervised learning algorithms (nearest centroid, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, linear and quadratic discriminant analyses, support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural network). When features are processed together, excellent output maps, very close to or outperforming current standards in archaeology, are observed for almost all classifiers. The size of the training set can be drastically reduced (to ca. 300 samples) by majority voting, while maintaining performance at the highest level (about 99.5% for all performance scores). Note, however, that if the training set is inadequate or not fully representative, the classification results are poor. That said, the methods applied and tested here are extremely rapid. Extensive mapping, which would have been difficult with traditional, manual, or semiautomatic delineation of stones using a vector graphics editor, now becomes possible. This workflow generally surpasses pedestrian surveys using differential GPS or a total station. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

KC4B843W;journalArticle;2020;"Serna, Alejandro; Prates, Luciano; Mange, Emiliano; Salazar-Garcia, Domingo C.; Bataille, Clement P.";Implications for paleomobility studies of the effects of quaternary volcanism on bioavailable strontium: A test case in North Patagonia (Argentina);Journal of Archaeological Science;Strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86) are used as geochemical tracers for paleomobility studies because they display predictable and stable patterns in ecosystems primarily controlled by the underlying geological regimes. While bedrock geology is stable over thousands of years, geomorphological processes can influence the Sr-87/Sr-86 in ecosystems over archeologically relevant timescales. Among these geomorphological processes, the deposition and reworking of volcanic sediments over Quaternary timescales are little studied but could be an important control of Sr-87/Sr-86 variations in many archeological regions. North Patagonia is a key archeological region to address animal and human movements, and an ideal location to test the influence of Quaternary volcanism on Sr-87/Sr-86 variation as it is located downwind of major volcanic centers. In this study, we aim to assess the main environmental and geological controls of bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 and to build a high-resolution isoscape using a machine learning regression framework for forthcoming paleomobility studies. We sampled several locations and analyzed different types of samples (N = 94). The ratios show a limited range of variation, which is not related to the bedrock geology. Rather, bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 variations display a progressive increase going eastward (away from the Andes), following dust aerosol deposition and elevation variations (R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 0.00041). We argue that this trend relates to the deposition and reworking of unradiogenic volcanic sediments by aeolian, fluvial and glacial erosion during the Quaternary. As most of this sediment reworking occurred during glacial periods, the current bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 variations across the study area likely represent a long-term average that varied little during the Holocene. Consequently, our isoscape provides a solid base for Holocene paleomobility studies in North Patagonia and underlines the importance of Quaternary volcanism processes for interpreting Sr-87/Sr-86 data in paleomobility studies in volcanic regions.;Serna et al. - 2020 - Implications for paleomobility studies of the effe.txt
GFSLM36K;journalArticle;2020;"Stewart, Christopher; Labreche, Georges; Gonzalez, Daniel Lombrana";A Pilot Study on Remote Sensing and Citizen Science for Archaeological Prospection;Remote Sensing;Cost-effective techniques for systematic archaeological prospection are essential to improve the efficiency of preventive archaeology and the preservation of cultural heritage. Web Mapping Services, such as Microsoft Bing Maps, provide imagery covering extensive areas at high resolution. These can, in some cases, reveal cropmarks of buried historical structures. Given that archaeological prospection is not generally the priority of most common Web Mapping Services, the conditions under which images are acquired are not always suitable for the appearance of cropmarks. Therefore, their detection is typically serendipitous. This pilot project attempts to assess the potential to use the Microsoft Bing Maps Bird's Eye service within a crowdsourcing platform to systematically search for archaeological cropmarks in the surroundings of the city of Rome in Italy. On this platform, which is hosted by the company Scifabric (Southampton, UK) and based on PyBossa, an Open Source framework for crowdsourcing, members of the public are invited to interpret oblique air photo tiles of Bing Maps Bird's Eye. While the project is still on-going, at least one seamless coverage of tiles in the area of interest has been interpreted. For each tile, the Bing Maps Bird's Eye service provides oblique air photo coverage in up to four possible orientations. As of 5 July 2020, 18,765 of the total 67,014 tasks have been completed. Amongst these completed tasks, positive detections of cropmarks were recorded once for 1447 tasks, twice for 57 tasks, and three or more times for 10 tasks. While many of these detections may be erroneous, some correspond with archaeological cropmarks of buried remains of buildings, roads, aqueducts, and urban areas from the Roman period, as verified by comparison with archaeological survey data. This leads to the conclusion that the Bing Maps Bird's Eye service contains a wealth of information useful for archaeological prospection, and that to a certain extent citizen researchers could help to mine this information. However, a more thorough analysis would need to be carried out on possible false negatives and biases related to the varying ease of interpretation of residues of different archaeological structures from multiple historical periods. This activity forms the first part of a research project on the systematic prospection of archaeological cropmarks. The ultimate aim is to reach a critical mass of training data through crowdsourcing which can be augmented and used as input to train a machine learning algorithm for automatic detection on a larger scale.;Stewart et al. - 2020 - A Pilot Study on Remote Sensing and Citizen Scienc.txt

Yet, archaeological applications of predictive models are often insufficient due to small training data sets, inadequate statistical techniques, and a lack of theoretical insight to explain the responses of past land use to predictor variables. Here we address these critiques and evaluate the predictive power of four statistical approaches widely used in ecological modeling-generalized linear models, generalized additive models, maximum entropy, and random forests-to predict the locations of Formative Period (2100-650 BP) archaeological sites in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. We assess each modeling approach using a threshold-independent measure, the area under the curve (AUC), and threshold-dependent measures, like the true skill statistic. We find that the majority of the modeling approaches struggle with archaeological datasets due to the frequent lack of true-absence locations, which violates model assumptions of generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and random forests, as well as measures of their predictive power (AUC). Maximum entropy is the only method tested here which is capable of utilizing pseudo-absence points (inferred absence data based on known presence data) and controlling for a non-representative sampling of the landscape, thus making maximum entropy the best modeling approach for common archaeological data when the goal is prediction. Regression-based approaches may be more applicable when prediction is not the goal, given their grounding in well-established statistical theory. Random forests, while the most powerful, is not applicable to archaeological data except in the rare case where true-absence data exist. Our results have significant implications for the application of predictive models by archaeologists for research and conservation purposes and highlight the importance of understanding model assumptions.;Yaworsky et al. - 2020 - Advancing predictive modeling in archaeology An e.txt

Labeling this type of archaeological data is a tedious process. We used a data set from Pacunam LiDAR Initiative survey of lowland Maya region in Guatemala. The data set contains ancient Maya structures that were manually labeled, and ground verified to a large extent. We have built and compared two deep learning-based models, U-Net and Mask R-CNN, for semantic segmentation. The segmentation models were used in two tasks: identification of areas of ancient construction activity, and identification of the remnants of ancient Maya buildings. The U-Net based model performed better in both tasks and was capable of correctly identifying 60-66% of all objects, and 74-81% of medium sized objects. The quality of the resulting prediction was evaluated using a variety of quantifiers. Furthermore, we discuss the problems of re-purposing the archaeological style labeling for production of valid machine learning training sets. Ultimately, we outline the value of these models for archaeological research and present the road map to produce a useful decision support system for recognition of ancient objects in LiDAR data.;rs12223685.txt

In this article, we would like to present the results from one of the research projects pursued by our group, in which we automated the stratigraphic study of some historic buildings using multivariate statistic techniques. To this end, we first measured the building using surveying techniques to create a 3D model, and then, we broke down every stone into qualitative and quantitative variables. To identify the stratigraphic features on the walls, we applied machine learning by conducting different predictive and descriptive analyses. The predictive analyses were used to rule out any blocks of stone with different characteristics, such as rough stones, joint ashlars, and voussoirs of arches; these are irregularities that probably show building processes and whose identification is crucial in ascertaining the structural evolution of the building. In supervised learning, we experimented with decision trees and random forest- and although the results were good in all cases, we ultimately opted to implement the predictive model obtained using the last one. While identifying the evidence on the walls, it was also very important to identify different continuity solutions or interfaces present on them, because although these are elements without materiality, they are of great value in terms of timescale, because they delimit different strata and allow us to deduce the relationship between them.";Mesanza-Moraza et al. - 2021 - Machine Learning for the Built Heritage Archaeolog.txt

In this work we employ the first ever machine learning analysis of Australian rock art using a data efficient transfer learning approach to identify features suitable for distinguishing styles of rock art. These features are evaluated in a one-shot learning setting. Results demonstrate that known Arnhem Land Rock art styles can be resolved without knowledge of prior groupings. We then analyse the activation space of learned features and report on the relationships between styles and arrange these classes into a stylistic chronology based on distance within the activation space. By generating a stylistic chronology, it is shown that the model is sensitive to both temporal and spatial patterns in the distribution of rock art in the Arnhem Land Plateau region. More broadly, this approach is ideally suited to evaluating style within any material culture assemblage and overcomes the common constraint of small training data sets in archaeological machine learning studies.;Kowlessar et al. - 2021 - Reconstructing rock art chronology with transfer l.txt

The ArchAIDE project realised an AI-based application to recognise archaeological pottery. Pottery is of paramount importance for understanding archaeological contexts. However, recognition of ceramics is still a manual, time-consuming activity, reliant on analogue catalogues. The project developed two complementary machine-learning tools to propose identifications based on images captured on-site, for optimising and economising this process, while retaining key decision points necessary to create trusted results. One method relies on the shape of a potsherd; the other is based on decorative features. For the shape-based recognition, a novel deep-learning architecture was employed, integrating shape information from points along the inner and outer profile of a sherd. The decoration classifier is based on relatively standard architectures used in image recognition. In both cases, training the algorithms meant facing challenges related to real-world archaeological data: the scarcity of labelled data; extreme imbalance between instances of different categories; and the need to take note of minute differentiating features. Finally, the creation of a desktop and mobile application that integrates the AI classifiers provides an easy-to-use interface for pottery classification and storing pottery data.";Gualandi et al. - 2021 - An Open System for Collection and Automatic Recogn.txt
P9DPXPPH;journalArticle;2021;"Navarro, Pablo; Cintas, Celia; Lucena, Manuel; Manuel Fuertes, Jose; Delrieux, Claudio; Molinos, Manuel";Learning feature representation of Iberian ceramics with automatic classification models;Journal of Cultural Heritage;In Cultural Heritage inquiries, a common requirement is to establish time-based trends between archaeological artifacts belonging to different periods of a given culture, enabling among other things to determine chronological inferences with higher accuracy and precision. Among these, pottery vessels are significantly useful, given their relative abundance in most archaeological sites. However, this very abundance makes difficult and complex an accurate representation, since no two of these vessels are identical, and therefore classification criteria must be justified and applied. For this purpose, we propose the use of deep learning architectures to extract automatically learned features without prior knowledge or engineered features. By means of transfer learning, we retrained a Residual Neural Network with a binary image database of Iberian wheel-made pottery vessels' profiles. These vessels pertain to archaeological sites located in the upper valley of the Guadalquivir River (Spain). The resulting model can provide an accurate feature representation space, which can automatically classify profile images, achieving a mean accuracy of 0.96 with an f -measure of 0.96. This accuracy is remarkably higher than other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, where several feature extraction techniques were applied together with multiple classifier models. These results provide novel strategies to current research in automatic feature representation and classification of different objects of study within the Archaeology domain.

This tradition was particularly strong during the Nordic Bronze Age (1700-550 BC) in southern Scandinavia with over 20,000 boats and thousands of humans, animals, wagons, etc. This vivid and highly engaging material provides quantitative data of high potential to understand Bronze Age social structures and ideologies. The ability to provide the technically best possible documentation and to automate identification and classification of images would help to take full advantage of the research potential of petroglyphs in southern Scandinavia and elsewhere. We, therefore, attempted to train a model that locates and classifies image objects using faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster-RCNN) based on data produced by a novel method to improve visualizing the content of 3D documentations. A newly created layer of 3D rock art documentation provides the best data currently available and has reduced inscribed bias compared to older methods. Several models were trained based on input images annotated with bounding boxes produced with different parameters to find the best solution. The data included 4305 individual images in 408 scans of rock art sites. To enhance the models and enrich the training data, we used data augmentation and transfer learning. The successful models perform exceptionally well on boats and circles, as well as with human figures and wheels. This work was an interdisciplinary undertaking which led to important reflections about archaeology, digital humanities, and artificial intelligence. The reflections and the success represented by the trained models open novel avenues for future research on rock art.;Horn et al. - 2022 - Artificial Intelligence, 3D Documentation, and Roc.txt

Provenancing biological materials using strontium isotope ratios requires a map of bioavailable strontium, commonly known as an isoscape, to compare results with. Both producing the isoscape and using it to interpret results present methodological challenges that researchers must carefully consider. A review of current research indicates that, while many archives can be analyzed to produce isoscapes, modern plant materials usually provide the best approximation of bioavailable strontium and can be used alone or combined with other archives if applying machine learning. Domain mapping currently produces the most accurate, most interpretable isoscapes for most research questions; however, machine learning approaches promise to provide more accurate and geographically wide-ranging isoscapes over time. Using strontium isotope analysis for provenancing is most successful when combined with other isotopes and/or trace elements as part of a likelihood approach. Strontium isoscapes that are both appropriate and sufficiently high resolution to answer specific research questions do not exist for most parts of the world. Researchers intending to incorporate strontium analysis into their research designs should expect to conduct primary sampling and analysis to create appropriate isoscapes or refine existing ones, which should themselves not be uncritically utilized. When sampling, it is essential to collect appropriate metadata; these metadata and the results of the analyses should be archived in one of several online databases to maximize their usefulness. With increasing amounts of primary data and the likely increased availability of machine learning approaches to mapping, strontium analysis will continue to improve as a method of provenancing.";Holt et al. - 2021 - Strontium (Sr-87Sr-86) mapping A critical review.txt

This work is intended to apply a new methodology to the field of underwater archaeology. Shipwrecks represent a major resource to understand maritime human activity over millennia, but underwater archaeology is expensive, misappropriated, and hazardous. An automated tool to rapidly detect and map shipwrecks can therefore be used to create more accurate maps of natural and archaeological features to aid management objectives, study patterns across the landscape, and find new features. Additionally, more comprehensive and accurate shipwreck maps can help to prioritize site selection and plan excavation. The model is based on open source topo-bathymetric data and shipwreck data for the United States available from NOAA. The model uses transfer learning to compensate for a relatively small sample size and addresses a recurring problem that associated work has had with false positives by training the model both on shipwrecks and background topography. Results of statistical analyses conducted-ANOVAs and box and whisker plots-indicate that there are substantial differences between the morphologic characteristics that define shipwrecks vs. background topography, supporting this approach to addressing false positives. The model uses a YOLOv3 architecture and produced an F1 score of 0.92 and a precision score of 0.90, indicating that the approach taken herein to address false positives was successful.;rs13091759.txt
SB9UIUMI;journalArticle;2021;"Abitbol, Roy; Shimshoni, Ilan; Ben-Dov, Jonathan";Machine Learning Based Assembly of Fragments of Ancient Papyrus;Acm Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage;The task of assembling fragments in a puzzle-like manner into a composite picture plays a significant role in the field of archaeology as it supports researchers in their attempt to reconstruct historic artifacts. In this article, we propose a method for matching and assembling pairs of ancient papyrus fragments containing mostly unknown scriptures. Papyrus paper is manufactured from papyrus plants and therefore portrays typical thread patterns resulting from the plant's stems. The proposed algorithm is founded on the hypothesis that these thread patterns contain unique local attributes such that nearby fragments show similar patterns reflecting the continuations of the threads. We posit that these patterns can be exploited using image processing and machine learning techniques to identify matching fragments. The algorithm and system which we present support the quick and automated classification of matching pairs of papyrus fragments as well as the geometric alignment of the pairs against each other. The algorithm consists of a series of steps and is based on deep-learning and machine learning methods. The first step is to deconstruct the problem of matching fragments into a smaller problem of finding thread continuation matches in local edge areas (squares) between pairs of fragments. This phase is solved using a convolutional neural network ingesting raw images of the edge areas and producing local matching scores. The result of this stage yields very high recall but low precision. Thus, we utilize these scores in order to conclude about the matching of entire fragments pairs by establishing an elaborate voting mechanism. We enhance this voting with geometric alignment techniques from which we extract additional spatial information. Eventually, we feed all the data collected from these steps into a Random Forest classifier in order to produce a higher order classifier capable of predicting whether a pair of fragments is a match. Our algorithm was trained on a batch of fragments which was excavated from the Dead Sea caves and is dated circa the 1st century BCE. The algorithm shows excellent results on a validation set which is of a similar origin and conditions. We then tried to run the algorithm against a real-life set of fragments for which we have no prior knowledge or labeling of matches. This test batch is considered extremely challenging due to its poor condition and the small size of its fragments. Evidently, numerous researchers have tried seeking matches within this batch with very little success. Our algorithm performance on this batch was sub-optimal, returning a relatively large ratio of false positives. However, the algorithm was quite useful by eliminating 98% of the possiblematches thus reducing the amount of work needed formanual inspection. Indeed, experts that reviewed the results have identified some positive matches as potentially true and referred them for further investigation.;Abitbol et al. - 2021 - Machine Learning Based Assembly of Fragments of An.txt

The so-called scan-to-BIM process can, in fact, benefit from such data, and they can themselves be a source for further analyses or activities on the archaeological and built heritage. There are several ways to exploit this type of data, such as Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM), mesh creation, rasterisation, classification, and semantic segmentation. The latter, referring to point clouds, is a trending topic not only in the CH domain but also in other fields like autonomous navigation, medicine or retail. Precisely in these sectors, the task of semantic segmentation has been mainly exploited and developed with artificial intelligence techniques. In particular, machine learning (ML) algorithms, and their deep learning (DL) subset, are increasingly applied and have established a solid state-of-the-art in the last half-decade. However, applications of DL techniques on heritage point clouds are still scarce; therefore, we propose to tackle this framework within the built heritage field. Starting from some previous tests with the Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN), in this research close attention is paid to: i) the investigation of fine-tuned models, used as a transfer learning technique, ii) the combination of external classifiers, such as Random Forest (RF), with the artificial neural network, and iii) data augmentation results evaluation for the domain-specific ArCH dataset.

Mapping the piles of such sites is an indispensable basis to the exploitation of the high resolution absolute chronological data gained through dendrochronology. In a case study at the underwater site of Plo.ca, Mi.cov Grad at Lake Ohrid, North Macedonia, nine consecutive 10 m(2) strips and a 6 m(2) excavation section were uncovered, the situation documented, and the wood piles sampled. The gained data was vectorized in a geographic information system. During two field campaigns, a total of 794 wooden elements on a surface of 96 m(2) could be documented three-dimensionally with a residual error of less than 2 cm. The exceptionally high number of fishes in the 5 m deep water resulted in a significant covering of potentially important information on the relevant photos. We present a machine learning approach, especially developed and successfully applied to the automatic detection and masking of these fishes in order to eliminate them from the images. The discussed documentation workflow enables an efficient, cost-effective, accurate and reproducible mapping of pile fields.

Despite promising results in the detection phase, there is still a lack of a standard set of measures to evaluate the performance of object detection methods, since buried archaeological sites often have distinctive shapes that set them aside from other types of objects included in mainstream remote sensing datasets (e.g., Dataset of Object deTection in Aerial images, DOTA). Additionally, archaeological research relies heavily on geospatial information when validating the output of an object detection procedure, a type of information that is not normally considered in regular machine learning validation pipelines. This paper tackles these shortcomings by introducing two novel automatic evaluation measures, namely 'centroid-based' and 'pixel-based', designed to encode the salient aspects of the archaeologists' thinking process. To test their usability, an experiment with different object detection deep neural networks was conducted on a LiDAR dataset. The experimental results show that these two automatic measures closely resemble the semi-automatic one currently used by archaeologists and therefore can be adopted as fully automatic evaluation measures in archaeological remote sensing detection. Adoption will facilitate cross-study comparisons and close collaboration between machine learning and archaeological researchers, which in turn will encourage the development of novel human-centred archaeological object detection tools.;Fiorucci et al. - 2022 - Deep Learning for Archaeological Object Detection .txt

The results of such a process are used in archaeology for analyzing the origin and manufacturing techniques of ancient ceramics. In this paper we present a methodology for the segmentation and analysis of thin sections of material segments and reaching some conclusions in a fully automatic way. We employ machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze a video of the thin section sample, acquired under an optical microscope. When examined under polarized light, the color of segments may vary during sample rotation. This variation is due to the optical properties of the materials and it provides valuable information about the material inclusions in the sample. Using the video as our input, we perform an entire-video segmentation. To accomplish this task, we developed a hierarchical categorical mean-shift-based algorithm. Using the entire-video segmentation we examine the detected segments and gather statistical information about their sizes, shapes and colors and present an overall report about the sample. We tested the algorithm on nine specimens of ancient ceramics, taken from three different Mediterranean sites.

We evaluate past uses of radar, multispectral, and LiDAR datasets in Northwest Belize across well-studied wetland field complexes that occur under different vegetation conditions. Next, we compare topographic products derived from LiDAR data commonly used for archaeology and geomorphology. Lastly, we train a machine learning algorithm to detect ancient canals with LiDAR data and test the algorithm on a newly rediscovered field system. The spatial resolution of any dataset must be sufficiently high (2-m or finer resolution) to detect most of these canals reliably. High resolution multispectral sensors can detect canals in open areas, but most wetland complexes are under dense tropical forest impenetrable to multispectral instruments. LiDAR data were the most useful due to the high spatial resolution (0.5-m) and the ability to penetrate canopy, but still have limitations under certain conditions. The intensity of the LiDAR returns with multispectral LiDAR systems can reveal differences in soil and vegetation between ancient canals and fields in places leveled by modern farmers. The algorithm successfully maps ancient canals but has many false positives in natural depressions and drainages. Although the machine learning approach tested here cannot be used on its own, we used it with the LiDAR visualizations to refine the canal estimates from previous studies, mapping nearly 50% more canals in the Central Rio Bravo floodplain than originally published.;Doyle et al. - Advances in remote sensing of the early Anthropoce.txt

However, recent technological advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular deep learning methods, open possibilities for the automated analysis of large areas of remote sensing data. This paper examines the applicability and potential of supervised deep learning methods for the detection and mapping of different kinds of archaeological sites comprising features such as walls and linear or curvilinear structures of different dimensions, spectral and geometrical properties. Our work deliberately uses open-source imagery to demonstrate the accessibility of these tools. One of the main challenges facing AI approaches has been that they require large amounts of labeled data to achieve high levels of accuracy so that the training stage requires significant computational resources. Our results show, however, that even with relatively limited amounts of data, simple eight-layer, fully convolutional network can be trained efficiently using minimal computational resources, to identify and classify archaeological sites and successfully distinguish them from features with similar characteristics. By increasing the number of training sets and switching to the use of high-performance computing the accuracy of the identified areas increases.

The first  applications of topology to data emphasized the global shape of a dataset, such  as the three-circle model for 3 × 3 pixel patches from natural images, or the  configuration space of the cyclo-octane molecule, which is a sphere with a Klein  bottle attached via two circles of singularity. In these studies of global shape,  short persistent homology bars are disregarded as sampling noise. More recently,  however, persistent homology has been used to address questions about the local  geometry of data. For instance, how can local geometry be vectorized for use in  machine learning problems? Persistent homology and its vectorization methods,  including persistence landscapes and persistence images, provide popular  techniques for incorporating both local geometry and global topology into machine  learning. Our meta-hypothesis is that the short bars are as important as the long  bars for many machine learning tasks. In defense of this claim, we survey  applications of persistent homology to shape recognition, agent-based modeling,  materials science, archaeology, and biology.

This paper explores the potential of a  simple digital framework to increase the explanatory power of multiproxy data by  enabling the incorporation of incompatible, ambiguous datasets in a single model.  In order to achieve this, Bayesian confirmation was used in combination with  decision trees. The results of phytolith and geochemical analyses carried out on  soil samples from ephemeral sites in Jordan are used here as a case study. The  combination of the two datasets as part of a single model enabled us to refine  the initial interpretation of the use of space at the archaeological sites by  providing an alternative identification for certain activity areas. The potential  applications of this model are much broader, as it can also help researchers in  other domains reach an integrated interpretation of analysis results by combining  different datasets.;Vos et al. - 2021 - A model based on Bayesian confirmation and machine.txt

In this pilot study, controlled  experiments were used to heat 14 fleshed and defleshed pig vertebrae (wet bones)  and archaeological human vertebrae (dry bones) to temperatures of 400, 600, 800,  and 1000°C. Specular component included (SCI) color values were recorded from the  bone surfaces with a Konica-Minolta cm-2600d spectrophotometer. These color  values were regressed onto heating temperature, using both a traditional linear  model and the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) machine-learning algorithm. Mean absolute  errors (MAE) were computed for 1000 rounds of temperature prediction. With the  k-NN approach, the median MAE prediction errors were 41.6°C for the entire  sample, and 20.9°C for the subsample of wet bones. These results indicate that  spectrophotometric color measurements combined with machine learning methods can  be a viable tool for estimating bone heating temperature.;1556-4029.13858.txt

Exemplarily, this is carried out using a database of 1365 Neolithic sites in the  Weiße Elster river catchment in Central Germany located between the southernmost  part of the Northern German Plain and the Central Uplands. The recorded sites are  systematically pre-processed with regard to their chronology, functional  interpretation and spatial delineation. The quality of the dataset is reviewed by  analyzing site distributions with respect to field surveys and modern land use.  The Random Forests machine learning algorithm is used to examine the impact of  terrain covariates on the depth of sites and pottery preservation. Neolithic  settlement dynamics are studied using Site Exploitation Territories, and site  frequencies per century are used to compare the intensity of land use with  adjacent landscapes. The results show that the main trends of the Neolithic  settlement dynamics can be derived from the dataset. However, Random Forests  analyses indicate poor pottery preservation in the Central Uplands and a  superimposition of Neolithic sites in the southernmost part of the Northern  German Plain. Throughout the Neolithic the margins between soils on loess and the  Weiße Elster floodplain were continuously settled, whereas only Early and Late  Neolithic land use also extended into the Central Uplands. These settlement  patterns are reflected in the results of the Site Exploitation Territories  analyses and explained with environmental economic factors. Similar with adjacent  landscapes the Middle Neolithic site frequency is lower compared to earlier and  later periods.;Miera et al. - 2022 - Large-scale investigations of Neolithic settlement.txt

The underappreciated power of de novo methods of mass spectrometric peptide identification.;Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society;Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a popular and powerful method for precise and highly multiplexed protein identification. The most common method of  analyzing untargeted proteomics data is called database searching, where the  database is simply a collection of protein sequences from the target organism,  derived from genome sequencing. Experimental peptide tandem mass spectra are  compared to simplified models of theoretical spectra calculated from the  translated genomic sequences.

In these cases,  de novo peptide identification can play an important role. De novo methods infer  peptide sequence directly from the tandem mass spectrum without reference to a  sequence database, usually using graph-based or machine learning algorithms.

Critical  interpretations of when humans started eating meat and animal fat or when they  started using stone tools, or when they occupied new continents or interacted  with predatory guilds impinge on accurate identifications of BSM. Until now,  interpretations of Plio-Pleistocene BSM have been contentious because of the high  uncertainty in discriminating among taphonomic agents. Recently, the use of  machine learning algorithms has yielded high accuracy in the identification of  BSM. A branch of machine learning methods based on imaging, computer vision (CV),  has opened the door to a more objective and accurate method of BSM  identification. The present work has selected two extremely similar types of BSM  (cut marks made on fleshed an defleshed bones) to test the immense potential of  artificial intelligence methods. This CV approach not only produced the highest  accuracy in the classification of these types of BSM until present (95% on  complete images of BSM and 88.89% of images of only internal mark features), but  it also has enabled a method for determining which inconspicuous microscopic  features determine successful BSM discrimination.

This is achieved by  evaluating sexual dimorphism of commonly used and new skeletal elements via uni-  and multi-variate metric trait analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two  skeletal traits were evaluated in 86 individuals from the William M. Bass donated  cremated collection of known sex and age-at-death. Four different predictive  models, logistic regression, random forest, neural network, and calculation of  population specific cut-off points, were used to determine the classification  accuracy (CA) of each feature and several combinations thereof. RESULTS: An  overall CA of ? 80% was obtained for 12 out of 22 features (humerus trochlea  max., and lunate length, humerus head vertical diameter, humerus head transverse  diameter, radius head max., femur head vertical diameter, patella width, patella  thickness, and talus trochlea length) using univariate analysis. Multivariate  analysis showed an increase of CA (? 95%) for certain combinations and models  (e.g., humerus trochlea max. and patella thickness). Our study shows metric  sexual dimorphism to be well preserved in calcined human remains, despite the  changes that occur during burning. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the  potential of machine learning approaches, such as neural networks, for  multivariate analyses. Using these statistical methods improves the rate of  correct sex estimations in calcined human remains and can be applied to highly  fragmented unburnt individuals from both archaeological and forensic contexts.;ajpa.24270.txt

We developed a pre-screening protocol  based on attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier-transform infrared  spectroscopy (FTIR) for assessing the chemical composition and mineralogy of  ancient bone samples. METHODS: ATR-FTIR measurements were performed on bulk bones  of diverse origin and age before collagen extraction. The percentage nitrogen of  bulk bones, as well as the weight percentage, and the percentage carbon and  nitrogen of extracted organic matter were noted. Several machine learning  algorithms were applied to the spectral data and compared for their efficacy in  screening for well preserved collagen. RESULTS: The results showed that (a) the  first derivative of the spectral data was better suited to screening than the raw  FTIR data, especially for a wider spectral range and (b) certain classification  algorithms [e.g. gradient boosting machine (GBM)] were able to efficiently  predict the degree of preservation in bone samples. CONCLUSIONS: This  pre-screening protocol can serve as a fast, concise and inexpensive pre-screening  tool for determining relative degrees of preservation before collagen extraction  and subsequent (14) C dating. The screening power based on the machine learning  techniques can be further improved by accumulating the FTIR spectral data of  bones.;rcm.8720.txt

These textual inputs often contain inaccuracies, contradictions and are seldom given in a well-structured form. The issues mentioned in the previous thought frequently result in the program not satisfying the expectation of the stakeholders. In particular, for non-functional requirements, clients rarely emphasize these specifications as much as they might be justified. Identifying, classifying and reconciling the requirements is one of the main duty of the System Analyst, which without using a proper tool, can be very demanding and time-consuming.

The complexity of these ancient and historical materials, which are chemically heterogeneous, the product of alteration processes, and inherently not reproducible, is a major obstacle to a thorough understanding of their making and long-term behavior (e.g., fossilization). These challenges required the development of methodologies and instruments coupling imaging and data processing approaches that are optimized for the specific properties of the materials. This Account discusses how these characteristics not only constrain their study but also open up specific innovative avenues for providing key historical information. Synchrotron methods have extensively been used since the late 1990s to study heritage objects, in particular for their potential to provide speciation information from excitation spectroscopies and to image complex heritage objects and samples in two and three dimensions at high resolution. We examine in practice how the identification of key intrinsic chemical specificities has offered fertile ground for the development of novel synchrotron approaches allowing a better stochastic description of the properties of ancient and historical materials. These developments encompass three main aspects: (1) The multiscale heterogeneity of these materials can provide an essential source of information in the development of probes targeting their multiple scales of homogeneity. (2) Chemical alteration can be described in many ways, e.g., by segmenting datasets in a semiquantitative way to jointly inform morphological and chemical transformation pathways. (3) The intrinsic individuality of chemical signatures in artifacts triggers the development of specific strategies, such as those focusing on weak signal detection. We propose a rereading of the advent of these new methodologies for analysis and characterization and examine how they have led to innovative strategies combining materials science, instrument development, history, and data science. In particular, we show that spectral imaging and the search for correlations in image datasets have provided a powerful way to address what archeologists have called the uncertainty and ambiguity of the material record. This approach has implications beyond synchrotron techniques and extends in particular to a series of rapidly developing approaches that couple spectral and spatial information, as in hyperspectral imaging and spatially resolved mass spectrometry. The preeminence of correlations holds promise for the future development of machine learning methods for processing data on historical objects. Beyond heritage, these developments are an original source of inspiration for the study of materials in many related fields, such as environmental, geochemical, or life sciences, which deal with systems whose alteration and heterogeneity cannot be neglected.;Bertrand et al. - 2021 - Deciphering the Chemistry of Cultural Heritage Ta.txt

There are traditional methods for constructing models that give good results for stature estimation. In this paper, we aim to investigate the usefulness of using machine learning-based models to approximate stature. Assuming that the stature of an individual is indirectly related to bone measurement values, we can derive methods that learn from archaeological data and construct models that give good estimates of the stature. Two novel machine learning-based regression models for stature estimation are proposed in this paper. Experiments using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms were performed on samples from the Terry Collection Postcranial Osteometric Database, and the obtained results are discussed and compared with the results from other similar studies. The experimental evaluations indicate that the machine learning-based regression models are efficient for the stature estimation of archaeological remains and highlight the potential of our proposal.

However, due to the costs and efforts required for ancient biomolecular analysis, there has been considerable research into development of accurate and efficient screening approaches for archaeological remains. FTIR spectroscopy is one such approach that has been considered for screening of proteins, but its widespread use has been hindered by the fact that its predictive accuracy can vary widely depending on the extent of sample preservation and the instrument used. Further, screening methods for ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis are scarce. Here we present a new approach to vastly improve upon FTIR-based screening methods prior to ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) and aDNA analysis through the use of random forest-based machine learning. To do so, we use ATR-FTIR to examine three sets of archaeological bone assemblages and analyse them by ZooMS (for taxonomic identification). Two of these are from Palaeolithic contexts, dominated by terrestrial fauna and include specimens with a variety of preservational conditions. The third set consists of Holocene faunal remains, with variable levels of preservation and is dominated by cetaceans. Using the Holocene faunal remains, we were able to more consistently evaluate ATR-FTIR-based screening for mtDNA as well as ZooMS success. We report on the potential of machine learning in ATR-FTIR-based screening for ancient mtDNA analysis, and our machine learning models conclusively improve the accuracy prior to usage of ATR-FTIR-based screening for ZooMS by 20?40%. The results also suggest this approach potentially allows for a universal screening system, applicable across multiple sites and largely independent of the spectrometers used.;j.jas.2020.105311.txt

Such facilities are rare in Egypt and modern dating techniques which are indispensable in Geoarchaeology to establish a robust chronology are not available, as sample transport is restricted and Egypt does not provide OSL or AMS C-14 laboratories. With these preconditions, we evaluate the usability of pXRF geochemical data for the dating of archaeological sediments with machine learning techniques. The sample material was collected via sampling of archaeological sections and profile walls from archaeological excavations in the northwestern Nile delta at the settlement site Buto (Tell el-Fara'in) and Kom el-Gir. Additionally, samples were taken from sediments and cultural layers uncovered from their surroundings using vibracore corings with open steel auger heads. In this methodological approach, we examine the applicability of pXRF methods and test the sample data for distinct geochemical differences between the main settlement phases with multivariate statistical methods. The dating is based on the training of artificial neural networks with pXRF data from archaeological material of well-dated context to date test data of cultural layers within the vibracores.

These tiny artifacts tend to become embedded in the locations where they were first deposited and are less vulnerable to post-depositional movement, making microdebitage an important artifact class for identifying primary areas of stone tool production. Traditional microdebitage analysis, however, can take multiple hours spread over several days to complete. Because of this, microdebitage analysis is typically completed in very small areas of sites due to the intensive time and labor commitment required. Recently, however, my colleagues and I have developed a novel, interdisciplinary method that combines dynamic image analysis and machine learning to analyze microdebitage taken from soil samples at archaeological sites. Analyses of experimental microdebitage demonstrated that microdebitage could be accurately and efficiently identified within archaeological soil samples using this method.

Other researchers have argued that multivariate methods can efficiently separate both types of marks. Differentiating both taphonomic agents is crucial for determining the ear-liest evidence of carcass processing by hominins. Here, we use an updated machine learning approach (discarding artificially bootstrapping the original imbalanced samples) to show that microscopic features shaped as categorical variables, corresponding to intrinsic properties of mark structure, can accurately discriminate both types of bone modifications. We also implement new deep-learning methods that objectively achieve the highest accuracy in differentiating cut marks from crocodile tooth scores (99% of testing sets). The present study shows that there are precise ways of differentiating both taphonomic agents, and this invites taphonomists to apply them to controversial paleontological and archaeological specimens.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Drawing on developments in computer vision and machine learning, this has the potential to fundamentally recast the capacity of archaeological prospection to cover large areas and deal with mass data, breaking a dependency on human resource. Without such developments, the potential of the vast amount of archaeological information embedded in large topographic and image-based datasets cannot be realized. The purpose of the case study reported on here is to assess existing developments in a Norwegian study against digital topographic data for the island of Arran, Scotland, examining the transferability of the approach and providing a proof of concept in a Scottish context. For Arran, three monument classes were assessed - prehistoric roundhouses, shieling huts of medieval or post-medieval date, and small clearance cairns. These present different challenges to detection, with preliminary results ranging from a manageable mix of false positives and true identifications to the chaotic. The influence of variable morphology and the occurrence of other, largely natural, objects of confusion in the landscape is discussed, highlighting the potential improvements in automated detection routines offered by adding anthropogenic and natural false positives to additional confusion classes.;arp.1731.txt

Archaeologists use insights from the experimental replication of lithics to understand phenomena such as the behaviours and cognitive capacities required to manufacture them. However, such experiments can require large amounts of time and raw materials, and achieving sufficient control of key variables can be difficult. A computer program able to accurately simulate stone tool production would make lithic experimentation faster, more accessible, reproducible, less biased, and may lead to reliable insights into the factors that structure the archaeological record. We present here a proof of concept for a machine learning-based virtual knapping framework capable of quickly and accurately predicting flake removals from 3D cores using a conditional adversarial neural network (CGAN). We programmatically generated a testing dataset of standardised 3D cores with flakes knapped from them. After training, the CGAN accurately predicted the length, volume, width, and shape of these flake removals using the intact core surface information alone. This demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning for investigating lithic production virtually. With a larger training sample and validation against archaeological data, virtual knapping could enable fast, cheap, and highly-reproducible virtual lithic experimentation.;Figueroa et al. - 2021 - A proof of concept for machine learning-based virt.txt

VKY5EPV9;journalArticle;2019;Dominguez-Rodrigo, M;Successful classification of experimental bone surface modifications (BSM) through machine learning algorithms: a solution to the controversial use of BSM in paleoanthropology?;ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES;Here, I show that powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms can efficiently classify most BSM of any given controlled experimental assemblage. In some cases, classification may reach an accuracy of 100%. No other statistical tool commonly used in taphonomy had been this successful at classification before. However, the heuristics of ML algorithms depend tightly on the objectivity in raw data collection. The use of multivariate approaches in which variables are independently scored by the analyst introduces a subjective bias. In this work, I show that different analysts producing raw data on the same testing data set can lead to widely divergent BSM classifications and interpretations using the same powerful ML algorithms. It is emphasized that until an objective non-biasing method of raw data collection is implemented, BSM classification carried out via statistical tests will remain heuristically limited. As a consequence, the application of these referents to archeological BSM does not guarantee a correct interpretation beyond the analyst expertise.;s12520-018-0684-9.txt

Due to restrictions on exporting geological samples from Egypt, modern geoscientific studies in the Nile Delta lack the possibility of dating the investigated sediments and geological features by standard techniques such as OSL or AMS C-14; therefore, this study aims to validate a new approach using machine-learning algorithms on portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) data. Archaeologically dated sediments from the archaeological excavations of Buto (Tell el-Fara'in; on-site) that pXRF analyses have geochemically characterized serve as training data for running and comparing Neural Nets, Random Forests, and single-decision trees. The established pXRF fingerprints are transferred via machine-learning algorithms to set up a chronology for undated sediments from sediment cores (i.e., the test data) of the nearby surroundings (off-site). Neural Nets and Random Forests work fine in dating sediments and deliver the best classification results compared with single-decision trees, which struggle with outliers and tend to overfit the training data. Furthermore, Random Forests can be modeled faster and are easier to understand than the complex, less transparent Neural Nets. Therefore, Random Forests provide the best algorithm for studies like this. Furthermore, river features east of Kom el-Gir are dated to pre-Ptolemaic times (before 332 B.C.) when Kom el-Gir had possibly not yet been settled. The research in this paper shows the success of close interactions from various scientific disciplines (Geoinformatics, Physical Geography, Archaeology, Ancient History) to decipher landscape evolution in the long-term-settled Nile Delta's environs using machine learning. With the approach's design and the possibility of integrating many other geographical/sedimentological methods, this study demonstrates the potential of the methodological approach to be applied in other geoscientific fields.";Seeliger-Comparing different machine-learning.txt

These deposits provide important insights into Native American socioeconomic organization but are also quite rare: only about 50 such rings have been documented to date. Recent work using automated LiDAR analysis demonstrates that many more shell rings likely exist than are currently recorded in state archaeological databases. Here, we use deep learning, a form of machine intelligence, to detect shell ring deposits and identify their geographic range in LiDAR data from South Carolina. We corroborate our results using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), multispectral data, and a random forest analysis. We conclude that a greater number of shell rings exist and that their distribution expanded further north than currently documented. Our evidence suggests that ring-construction was a more widespread and common practice during the mid-Holocene.;j.jas.2021.105433.txt
A2QXBKFI;journalArticle;2018;"Gu, MX; Buckley, M";Semi-supervised machine learning for automated species identification by collagen peptide mass fingerprinting;BMC BIOINFORMATICS;Background: Biomolecular methods for species identification are increasingly being utilised in the study of changing environments, both at the microscopic and macroscopic levels. High-throughput peptide mass fingerprinting has been largely applied to bacterial identification, but increasingly used to identify archaeological and palaeontological skeletal material to yield information on past environments and human-animal interaction. However, as applications move away from predominantly domesticate and the more abundant wild fauna to a much wider range of less common taxa that do not yet have genetically-derived sequence information, robust methods of species identification and biomarker selection need to be determined. Results: Here we developed a supervised machine learning algorithm for classifying the species of ancient remains based on collagen fingerprinting. The aim was to minimise requirements on prior knowledge of known species while yielding satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. The algorithm uses iterations of a modified random forest classifier with a similarity scoring system to expand its identified samples. We tested it on a set of 6805 spectra and found that a high level of accuracy can be achieved with a training set of five identified specimens per taxon. Conclusions: This method consistently achieves higher accuracy than two-dimensional principal component analysis and similar accuracy with hierarchical clustering using optimised parameters, which greatly reduces requirements for human input. Within the vertebrata, we demonstrate that this method was able to achieve the taxonomic resolution of family or sub-family level whereas the genus- or species-level identification may require manual interpretation or further experiments. In addition, it also identifies additional species biomarkers than those previously published.;Gu et Buckley - 2018 - Semi-supervised machine learning for automated spe.txt

A total of 48 fragments have been discovered in three locations; Bolgar, the Moscow Kremlin (MosKremlin), and Selitrennoe settlement (Selitrennoe). The assemblages were subjected to INAA in order to determine the concentrations of 37 elements in mg/kg. The data were analyzed using geochemical, bivariate, and multivariate statistical techniques. To classify the fragments according to their origin hierarchical clustering (HCA), linear discriminant (LDA), and principal component analyses (PCA) were used. Based on the INAA results, the first attempt was made to apply machine learning methods to the study of artifacts in Russia. The results show that they are reliable and powerful in extracting information about critical elements for identifying ceramic fragments and using them as chemical fingerprints. Chromium was the most useful element and was used in conjunction with other elements as a fingerprint to distinguish sherds. Chemical and statistical analyses help to establish of reference groups for medieval archeological pottery, which will be used in the future to classify and identify various unknown sherds. These reference groups serve as baseline data for determining the fragment's place of manufacture and are considered a reasonable judgment based on experimental data.";Badawy et al. - 2022 - Formation of reference groups for archaeological p.txt

This most crucial part of taphonomic analysis of the archaeological human record has been controversial due to highly subjective interpretations of BSM. Here, we use a sample of 79 trampling and cut marks to compare the accuracy in mark identification on bones by human experts and computer trained algorithms. We demonstrate that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and support vector machines (SVM) can recognize marks with accuracy that far exceeds that of human experts. Automated recognition and analysis of BSM using DCNN can achieve an accuracy of 91% of correct identification of cut and trampling marks versus a much lower accuracy rate (63%) obtained by trained human experts. This success underscores the capability of machine learning algorithms to help resolve controversies in taphonomic research and, more specifically, in the study of bone surface modifications. We envision that the proposed methods can help resolve on-going controversies on the earliest human meat-eating behaviors in Africa and other issues such as the earliest occupation of America.

Species identification is hindered because of the few taxonomically informative structures available, making the task laborious and genus definition controversial. Thus, its taxonomy is one of the most complex among Nematoda. Eggs are the parasitic structures most viewed in coprological analysis in both modern and ancient samples; consequently, their presence is indicative of positive diagnosis for infection. The structure of the egg could play a role in genera or species discrimination. Institutional biological collections are taxonomic repositories of specimens described and strictly identified by systematics specialists.MethodsThe present work aims to characterize eggs of capillariid species deposited in institutional helminth collections and to process the morphological, morphometric and ecological data using machine learning (ML) as a new approach for taxonomic identification. Specimens of 28 species and 8 genera deposited at ColecAo Helmintologica do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (CHIOC, IOC/FIOCRUZ/Brazil) and Collection de Nematodes Zooparasites du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris (MNHN/France) were examined under light microscopy. In the morphological and morphometric analyses (MM), the total length and width of eggs as well as plugs and shell thickness were considered. In addition, eggshell ornamentations and ecological parameters of the geographical location (GL) and host (H) were included.ResultsThe performance of the logistic model tree (LMT) algorithm showed the highest values in all metrics compared with the other algorithms. Algorithm J48 produced the most reliable decision tree for species identification alongside REPTree. The Majority Voting algorithm showed high metric values, but the combined classifiers did not attenuate the errors revealed in each algorithm alone. The statistical evaluation of the dataset indicated a significant difference between trees, with GL+H+MM and MM only with the best scores.ConclusionsThe present research proposed a novel procedure for taxonomic species identification, integrating data from centenary biological collections and the logic of artificial intelligence techniques.

UAE6HTLG;journalArticle;2022;Prasomphan, S;Toward Fine-grained Image Retrieval with Adaptive Deep Learning for Cultural Heritage Image;COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING;Fine-grained image classification is a challenging research topic because of the high degree of similarity among categories and the high degree of dissimilarity for a specific category caused by different poses and scales. A cultural heritage image is one of the fine-grained images because each image has the same similarity in most cases. Using the classification technique, distinguishing cultural heritage architecture may be difficult. This study proposes a cultural heritage content retrieval method using adaptive deep learning for fine-grained image retrieval. The key contribution of this research was the creation of a retrieval model that could handle incremental streams of new categories while maintaining its past performance in old categories and not losing the old categorization of a cultural heritage image. The goal of the proposed method is to perform a retrieval task for classes. Incremental learning for new classes was conducted to reduce the re-training process. In this step, the original class is not necessary for re-training which we call an adaptive deep learning technique. Cultural heritage in the case of Thai archaeological site architecture was retrieved through machine learning and image processing. We analyze the experimental results of incremental learning for fine-grained images with images of Thai archaeological site architecture from world heritage provinces in Thailand, which have a similar architecture. Using a fine-grained image retrieval technique for this group of cultural heritage images in a database can solve the problem of a high degree of similarity among categories and a high degree of dissimilarity for a specific category. The proposed method for retrieving the correct image from a database can deliver an average accuracy of 85 percent. Adaptive deep learning for fine-grained image retrieval was used to retrieve cultural heritage content, and it outperformed state-of-theart methods in fine-grained image retrieval.;Prasomphan - 2023 - Toward Fine-grained Image Retrieval with Adaptive .txt
QLQM3LA2;journalArticle;2019;"Grilli, E; Remondino, F";Classification of 3D Digital Heritage;REMOTE SENSING;In recent years, the use of 3D models in cultural and archaeological heritage for documentation and dissemination purposes is increasing. The association of heterogeneous information to 3D data by means of automated segmentation and classification methods can help to characterize, describe and better interpret the object under study. Indeed, the high complexity of 3D data along with the large diversity of heritage assets themselves have constituted segmentation and classification methods as currently active research topics. Although machine learning methods brought great progress in this respect, few advances have been developed in relation to cultural heritage 3D data. Starting from the existing literature, this paper aims to develop, explore and validate reliable and efficient automated procedures for the classification of 3D data (point clouds or polygonal mesh models) of heritage scenarios. In more detail, the proposed solution works on 2D data (texture-based approach) or directly on the 3D data (geometry-based approach) with supervised or unsupervised machine learning strategies. The method was applied and validated on four different archaeological/architectural scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is reliable and replicable and it is effective for restoration and documentation purposes, providing metric information e.g. of damaged areas to be restored.;Grilli et Remondino - 2019 - Classification of 3D Digital Heritage.txt

Through structure from motion (SfM) and multi-view-stereo (MVS) techniques, aerial imagery can provide a low-cost alternative compared to bathymetric LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) surveys, as it offers additional important visual information and higher spatial resolution. Nevertheless, water refraction poses significant challenges on depth determination. Till now, this problem has been addressed through customized image-based refraction correction algorithms or by modifying the collinearity equation. In this article, in order to overcome the water refraction errors in a massive and accurate way, we employ machine learning tools, which are able to learn the systematic underestimation of the estimated depths. In particular, an SVR (support vector regression) model was developed, based on known depth observations from bathymetric LiDAR surveys, which is able to accurately recover bathymetry from point clouds derived from SfM-MVS procedures. Experimental results and validation were based on datasets derived from different test-sites, and demonstrated the high potential of our approach. Moreover, we exploited the fusion of LiDAR and image-based point clouds towards addressing challenges of both modalities in problematic areas.";rs11192225.txt
4KEDNVIC;journalArticle;2021;"Davis, DS; Lundin, J";Locating Charcoal Production Sites in Sweden Using LiDAR, Hydrological Algorithms, and Deep Learning;REMOTE SENSING;Over the past several centuries, the iron industry played a central role in the economy of Sweden and much of northern Europe. A crucial component of iron manufacturing was the production of charcoal, which was often created in charcoal piles. These features are visible in LiDAR (light detection and ranging) datasets. These charcoal piles vary in their morphology by region, and training data for some feature types are severely lacking. Here, we investigate the potential for machine automation to aid archaeologists in recording charcoal piles with limited training data availability in a forested region of Jonkoping County, Sweden. We first use hydrological depression algorithms to conduct a preliminary assessment of the study region and compile suitable training data for charcoal production sites. Then, we use these datasets to train a series of RetinaNet deep learning models, which are less computationally expensive than many popular deep learning architectures (e.g., R-CNNs), allowing for greater usability. Together, our results demonstrate how charcoal piles can be automatically extracted from LiDAR datasets, which has great implications for improving our understanding of the long-term environmental impact of the iron industry across Northern Europe. Furthermore, our workflow for developing and implementing deep learning models for archaeological research can expand the use of such methods to regions that lack suitable training data.;Davis et Lundin - 2021 - Locating Charcoal Production Sites in Sweden Using.txt
ZUYHKAZB;journalArticle;2018;"Perry, GLW; O'Sullivan, D";Identifying Narrative Descriptions in Agent-Based Models Representing Past Human-Environment Interactions;JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL METHOD AND THEORY;There is a growing use of bottom-up simulation models to reconstruct past human-environment interactions. Such detailed representations pose difficult questions not only in their design (the generality-realism trade-off) but also about the inferences that are made from them. The historical sciences are faced with seeking to make robust inferences from limited, potentially biased and/or incomplete samples from uncontrolled systems, and as a result have sometimes employed narrative explanation. By contrast, simulation models can be used experimentally and can generate large amounts of data. Here, using an agent-based model of hunter-gatherer foraging in a previously unexplored ecosystem, we consider how narratives might be identified from the trajectories produced by simulations. We show how machine learning methods can isolate qualitatively similar types of model behaviour based on summaries of model outcomes and time series. We stand to learn from this approach because it enables us to answer two questions: (i) under what conditions (representations and/or parameterisations) do we observe in the model what is recorded in the archaeological and/or palaeoenvironmental record? and (ii) does the model yield unobserved dynamics? If so, are they plausible? Using models to develop narratives is a logical extension of the bottom-up approach inherent in agent-based modelling and has the potential, alongside conventional methods of model evaluation, to aid in learning from the rich dynamics of such simulations.;Perry et O'Sullivan - 2018 - Identifying Narrative Descriptions in Agent-Based .txt

A geometric-morphometric analysis of surface bone modifications of a Paranthropus boisei skeleton;QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL;Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania) is one of the key areas for the study of human origins, given the sheer abundance of archaeological and paleontological sites discovered. Several of these archaeological sites have yielded numerous hominin fossils and traces of their activities, thus offering invaluable insights into the nature and origins of human behavior. Nevertheless, certain taphonomic discussions that have been of great importance for the study of the South African cave sites have remained unnoticed in East Africa. One of these issues revolves around the interpretation of Paranthropus as a common prey of predators. In this paper, we analyze the postcranial remains of OH80, a partial skeleton of a Paranthropus boisei discovered at the BK site (Bell Korongo, Bed II of Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) in 2010. Some of the specimens of this skeleton have been reported to show surface modifications tentatively associated to the action of carnivores. Here, several pits observed on OH80-12, the Paranthropus boisei femur, were digitally reconstructed and analyzed through geometric morphometrics to determine the nature of the marks. The OH80-12 marks are compared with a modern sample of percussion marks and several carnivore tooth pits, since the action of both agents has previously been identified at the site and can sometimes result in equifinality problems. Alongside already published geometric morphometric tests, here we present a very newly developed approach based on the combination of geometric morphometric data and the training of machine learning algorithms. Both methodologies highlight that OH80 was consumed by carnivores, being a felid the most likely modifying agent.;j.quaint.2019.05.029.txt
CPVXAKV8;journalArticle;2021;"Brandsen, A; Lippok, F";A burning question-Using an intelligent grey literature search engine to change our views on early medieval burial practices in the Netherlands;JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE;This paper presents a case study on Early Medieval burial practices using AGNES, an intelligent search engine for Dutch archaeological grey literature. Traditionally, it is assumed that cremations phased out at the start of the Early Middle Ages, when the inhumation practice became more numerous. However, recent research (Lippok, 2020) shows that cremations might be more prevalent than previously assumed. Due to research efforts being concentrated on furnished inhumations, cremations and other types of burials have not received their share of research interest. It is suspected that unknown Early Medieval cremations may be found in grey literature research reports. The rapidly growing document collection requires more efficient methods to search through this big data, as manual searching is too time intensive. AGNES uses machine learning to allow searching on archaeological concepts (such as time periods and artefacts) in full texts, solving common problems with synonymy and polysemy. This paper describes a controlled search for Early Medieval cremations in the Netherlands, and a comparison of the new information uncovered from the reports to prior knowledge on the topic. The queries resulted in 2541 hits. Twenty-three Early Medieval cremations that were previously unknown to experts were uncovered, and 31 (of 77) known sites were identified. Forty-one possibly interesting documents were noted, where it was not clear from the report if Early Medieval cremations were present. 2446 documents were not relevant to the study for various reasons. The 23 new sites are an increase of 30% over the existing knowledge of experts. In the last 20 years only nine new sites featuring Early Medieval cremations were discovered, so being able to add another 23 is a major development. Adding previously unknown Early Medieval cremations to the dataset challenges the existing bias for inhumation graves, and supports striving towards viewing the Early Medieval burial repertoire as more heterogeneous and representative. This indicates that AGNES is useful for archaeological research, and the uncovered information can lead to a more cohesive view of the past.;j.jas.2021.105456.txt

With a deep learning approach for post-mortem interval estimation (ranging from one day to 2000 years) in bones, the estimation can be approximated with high precision. It is challenging to estimate the post-mortem interval (PMI) of skeletal remains within a forensic context. As a result of their interactions with the environment, bones undergo several chemical and physical changes after death. So far, multiple methods have been used to follow up on post-mortem changes. There is, however, no definitive way to estimate the PMI of skeletal remains. This research aimed to propose a methodology capable of estimating the PMI using micro-computed tomography measurements of 104 human skeletal remains with PMIs between one day and 2000 years. The present study indicates that micro-computed tomography could be considered an objective and precise method of PMI evaluation in forensic medicine.

Through its ability to penetrate forest canopies and detect microlandforms, Airborne Laser Scanning data reveal archaeological relics over large areas, from periods older than the first available Historical Topographic Maps. Mapping these traces from ALS-derived data (e.g. Digital Elevation Model (DEM)) thus allows for a determination of a new temporal baseline in order to evaluate the effects of a longer history on current patterns of biodiversity. Here, we evaluate the ability of traditional machine learning (Random Forest-RF) and deep learning (Fully Connected Networks-FCN) models to detect Medieval Terraced slopes and Ridges and Furrows (RaF) from an ALS-derived DEM in the southern Vosges (1462 km(2)). We used a combination of Local Binary Patterns and topographical metrics to measure properties of FFS and to train detection models. We then assessed the relative performance of each model semantically and spatially. Our results demonstrated the high suitability of our approach for reproducing major trends in the landscape with a high level of similarity between the predicted and reference spatial patterns (Structural Similarity Index - SSIM > 0.75). RF outperformed FCN for Terraced Slopes, whilst minimizing the false positive rate. FCN slightly outperformed RF for the RaF dataset but showed promising abilities to survey unseen data with a low sensitivity to annotation errors. We suggest that this approach has the potential to offer new spatio-temporal possibilities in Historical Ecology studies as a means of automatically detecting past archaeological ecosystems from a landscape to a regional scale.;Herrault et al. - 2021 - Automated detection of former field systems from a.txt

However, recognition of ceramics is still a manual, time-consuming activity, reliant on analogue catalogues created by specialists, held in archives and libraries. The ArchAIDE project worked to streamline, optimise, and economise the mundane aspects of these processes, using the latest automatic image recognition technology, while retaining key decision points necessary to create trusted results. The project has developed two complementary machine-learning tools to propose identifications based on images captured on site. One method relies on the shape of the fracture outline of a sherd; the other is based on decorative features. For the outline-identification tool, a novel deeplearning architecture was employed, integrating shape information from points along the inner and outer surfaces. The decoration classifier is based on relatively standard architectures used in image recognition. In both cases, training the classifiers required tackling challenges that arise when working with real-world archaeological data: the paucity of labelled data; extreme imbalance between instances of the different categories; and the need to avoid neglecting rare types and to take note of minute distinguishing features of some forms. The scarcity of training data was overcome by using synthetically-produced virtual potsherds and by employing multiple data-augmentation techniques.

The geographical area where they are present is considerable, from the Aralo-Caspian zone to central-western Arabia. Always present, several elements make up the layout of the kites, which makes them singular constructions and identifies them. However, variations in shape or size are observed throughout their extension area. Using qualitative and quantitative variables obtained by observing a sample of kites (10% of the total identified) on high-resolution satellite images, we propose a combination of exploratory statistical analysis, unsupervised machine learning approaches (PCA, clustering and association rules) and spatial analysis (neighbourhood) to establish a clustering of kites based on their morphological descriptions. This work allows to identify groups of kites sharing similar features, each of which is relatively circumscribed in geographic space. This regionalisation of morphologically homogeneous groups of kites could explain the temporality of the constructions while, despite recent fieldwork, dating is still rare.;Bouzid et Barge - 2022 - Towards a typology of desert kites combining quant.txt
9NJQNQDW;journalArticle;2018;Carranza, E;The study of lithic assemblages on deflation surfaces: The case study of Arroyo Verde, Northern Patagonia coast, Argentina;JOURNAL OF LITHIC STUDIES;This paper focuses on surface lithic artefacts from Holocene coastal hunter gatherer occupations of Arroyo Verde archaeological locality (Rio Negro province, Northern Patagonia, Argentina). The study of lithic assemblages collected at a deflation surface surrounded by stabilised sand dunes near the coastline, shows that wind produce significant corrasion (wind abrasion) of artefacts and affects preservation of small and medium size artefacts. The sample is mainly composed of chert knapping debitage with abraded and polished edges and surfaces. The artefact size distribution suggests that a subset of the assemblage exhibits good preservation, possibly due to the recent subaerial exposure. Furthermore, carbonate and mould coatings were recorded over the artefacts surface in contact with the ground, which indicates the presence of humid conditions in the sand dunes deflation area. In order to explore the factors that affected assemblage stability conditions in the locus, a machine learning based decision tree was applied. The model predicts and defines a threshold at which the occurrence of instability conditions may appear. Also, it suggests that relative altitude of artefacts within the deflation hollow is the primary variable explaining the exposure conditions recorded in the artefacts and it points out processes of differential deflation over time. The data presented here illustrates how wind alters local surface materials and emphasizes that a taphonomic perspective is needed to assess the formation processes within northern Patagonia coastal archaeological assemblages.;Carranza - 2018 - The study of lithic assemblages on deflation surfa.txt
DJ7IKC8H;journalArticle;2021;"Bordon, P; Martinelli, P; Medina, PZ; Bonomo, N; Ratto, NR";Automatic detection of mud-wall signatures in ground-penetrating radar data;ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION;The ground-penetrating radar (GPR) method with the standard constant-offset reflection mode allows to detect and map different types of archaeological structures, such as walls, foundations, floors and roads. The interpretation of the GPR data usually involves a detailed and time-consuming analysis of large amounts of information, which entails nonnegligible chances of errors, especially under nonideal fieldwork conditions. The application of suitable automatic detection algorithms can be useful to more rapidly and successfully complete the interpretation task. In this work, we explore the use of supervised machine learning methodologies to automatically detect mud-wall signatures in radargrams and to map the structures from these detections. Several algorithms, based on Viola-Jones cascade classifiers and the image feature descriptors Haar, histogram of oriented gradients and local binary patterns, were implemented. These algorithms were applied to datasets previously acquired in pre-Inca and Inca-Hispanic sites located in the Andean NW region of Argentina. The best algorithms provided very good detection rates for well-preserved walls and acceptable rates for deteriorated walls, with a low number of spurious predictions. They also exhibited the ability to detect collapsed walls and fragments detached from them. These are remarkable results because mud walls are usually difficult to be detected by conventional analysis, owing to the complex and variable characteristics of their reflection patterns. The results of the automatic detection techniques were represented in plan views and three-dimensional (3D) views that delineated in detail most of the structures of the sites. These algorithms are very fast, so applying them significantly reduces the interpretation times. In addition, once they have been trained using the patterns of one or several sites, they are directly applicable to other sites with similar characteristics.;arp.1799.txt
JHADZEXW;journalArticle;2022;"Raimundo, J; Medina, SLC; De Mata, JA; Prieto, JF";Multisensor Data Fusion by Means of Voxelization: Application to a Construction Element of Historic Heritage;REMOTE SENSING;Point clouds are very common tools used in the work of documenting historic heritage buildings. These clouds usually comprise millions of unrelated points and are not presented in an efficient data structure, making them complicated to use. Furthermore, point clouds do not contain topological or semantic information on the elements they represent. Added to these difficulties is the fact that a variety of different kinds of sensors and measurement methods are used in study and documentation work: photogrammetry, LIDAR, etc. Each point cloud must be fused and integrated so that decisions can be taken based on the total information supplied by all the sensors used. A system must be devised to represent the discrete set of points in order to organise, structure and fuse the point clouds. In this work we propose the concept of multispectral voxels to fuse the point clouds, thus integrating multisensor information in an efficient data structure, and applied it to the real case of a building element in an archaeological context. The use of multispectral voxels for the fusion of point clouds integrates all the multisensor information in their structure. This allows the use of very powerful algorithms such as automatic learning and machine learning to interpret the elements studied.;Raimundo et al. - 2022 - Multisensor Data Fusion by Means of Voxelization .txt

The near exclusive consumption of these millets results in extremely elevated bulk collagen delta C-13 values (similar to-7 parts per thousand to -5 parts per thousand), which serve as natural isotopic tracers in palaeodiet studies. Here we report individual amino acid delta C-13 results (delta C-13(AA)) for humans (n = 12) and animals (n = 9) that consumed varying amounts of millets at the Proto-Shang period (2000-1600 BC) site of Nancheng, China. Using established delta C-13(AA) proxies (Delta C-13(Gly-Phe), Delta C-13(val-Phe), and plots of delta C-13(phe) vs. delta C-13(val), delta C-13(Lys) vs. Delta C-13(Giy-phe), and delta C-13(Lys) vs. Delta C-13(va1-phe)) and machine learning assisted principal component analysis (MLA-PCA), we compared the Nancheng data to published known archaeological C-3, C-4, marine and freshwater protein consumers. Exclusive millet-consuming humans and animals from Nancheng displayed highly C-13-enriched amino acid results, which were distinct from C-4 consumers of maize (Zea mays) in the Americas. Compared to delta C-13(AA) dietary proxies, MLA-PCA provides improved separation for all of the different dietary categories reviewed. Further, this method was able to distinguish additional dietary details, such as identifying brackish species. Increased application of MLA-PCA in palaeodiet research utilizing delta C-13(AA) measurements could create regional and global aminoisoscapes that can reveal unique dietary and environmental information that is otherwise hidden by bulk and existing delta C-13(AA) proxy isotopic analyses.;j.jas.2020.105289.txt
EUXNSNKI;journalArticle;2010;"Toler-Franklin, C; Brown, B; Weyrich, T; Funkhouser, T; Rusinkiewicz, S";Multi-Feature Matching of Fresco Fragments;ACM TRANSACTIONS ON GRAPHICS;We present a multiple-feature approach for determining matches between small fragments of archaeological artifacts such as Bronze-Age and Roman frescoes. In contrast with traditional 2D and 3D shape matching approaches, we introduce a set of feature descriptors that are based on not only color and shape, but also normal maps. These are easy to acquire and combine high data quality with discriminability and robustness to some types of deterioration. Our feature descriptors range from general-purpose to domain-specific, and are quick to compute and match. We have tested our system on three datasets of fresco fragments, demonstrating that multi-cue matching using different subsets of features leads to different tradeoffs between efficiency and effectiveness. In particular, we show that normal-based features are more effective than color-based ones at similar computational complexity, and that 3D features are more discriminative than ones based on 2D or normals, but at higher computational cost. We also demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be used to effectively combine our new features with traditional ones. Our results show good retrieval performance, significantly improving upon the match prediction rate of state-of-the-art 3D matching algorithms, and are expected to extend to general matching problems in applications such as texture synthesis and forensics.;Toler-Franklin et al. - 2010 - Multi-Feature Matching of Fresco Fragments.txt

If left untreated, bronze disease can eat away at a bronze object until it is entirely deteriorated. The presence of copper trihydroxychlorides is indicative that this process is underway and therefore the detection of these corrosion products is necessary in guiding conservation of ancient bronze artefacts. In this paper we present a high spatial/spectral resolution short wave infrared (SWIR) imaging solution for mapping copper trihydroxychlorides in ancient bronze, combining hyperspectral imaging with an in-house developed unsupervised machine learning algorithm for automated spectral clustering. For this work, verification was obtained through use of an in-house developed reference database of typical ancient bronze corrosion products from several archaeological sites, and from collections of the National Museum of China. This paper also explores the suitability, and limitations, of a visible to near-infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral imaging system as a more accessible solution for mapping copper trihydroxychlorides associated with bronze disease.

ETPU3YMG;journalArticle;2021;"Dhivya, S; Devi, GU";TAMIZHI: Historical Tamil-Brahmi Script Recognition Using CNN and MobileNet;ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION PROCESSING;Computational epigraphy is the study of an ancient script where the computer science and mathematical model is relatively built for epigraphy. The Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions are the most ancient of the extant written of the Tamil. The inscriptions furnish valuable information on many aspects of life in the ancient Tamil country from a period anterior to the literary age of Sangam. The recognition of the script and systematic analysis of the script is required. The recognition of this script is complex, containing various curves for a single character and the style of writing overlap with curves and lines. Generating corpus of the script is necessary, since it is the initial step for computational epigraphy. The archaeological department has supported the raw data that helped to develop a corpus of Tamizhi. In this article, we have implemented a convolution neural network in various ways, i.e., (i) Training the CNN model from scratch a Softmax classifier in a sequential model (ii) using MobileNet: Transfer learning paradigm from a pre-trained model on a Tamizhi dataset (iii) Building Model with CNN and SVM (iv) SVM for evaluation of best accuracy to recognize handwritten Brahmi characters. To train the CNN Model an extensive TAMIZHI handwritten Brahmi Dataset of 1lakh and 90,000 isolated samples for the character has been created and deployed. The designed dataset consists of 9 vowels and 18 consonants and 209 class so researchers can use machine learning. MobileNet outperformed among all the models implemented with the accuracy of 68.3%, whereas other algorithm ranges from 58% to 67% with respect to the Tamizhi dataset. MobileNet model is trained and tested for the dataset of vowels (8 class), consonants (18 class), and consonants vowels (26 class) with the accuracy of 98.1%, 97.7%, 97.5%, respectively.;3402891.txt
NZ6IXMHA;journalArticle;2017;"Lowe, DJ; Pearce, NJG; Jorgensen, MA; Kuehn, SC; Tryon, CA; Hayward, CL";Correlating tephras and cryptotephras using glass compositional analyses and numerical and statistical methods: Review and evaluation;QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS;We define tephras and cryptotephras and their components (mainly ash-sized particles of glass crystals in distal deposits) and summarize the basis of tephrochronology as a chronostratigraphic correlational and dating tool for palaeoenvironmental, geological, and archaeological research. We then document and appraise recent advances in analytical methods used to determine the major, minor, and trace elements of individual glass shards from tephra or cryptotephra deposits to aid their correlation and application. Protocols developed recently for the electron probe microanalysis of major elements in individual glass shards help to improve data quality and standardize reporting procedures. A narrow electron beam (diameter similar to 3-5 gm) can now be used to analyze smaller glass shards than previously attainable. Reliable analyses of 'microshards' (defined here as glass shards < 32 gm in diameter) using narrow beams are useful for fine-grained samples from distal or ultra-distal geographic locations, and for vesicular or microlite-rich glass shards or small melt inclusions. Caveats apply, however, in the microprobe analysis of very small microshards (<=similar to 5 gm in diameter), where particle geometry becomes important, and of microlite-rich glass shards where the potential problem of secondary fluorescence across phase boundaries needs to be recognised. Trace element analyses of individual glass shards using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), with crater diameters of 20 mu m and 10 mu m, are now effectively routine, giving detection limits well below 1 ppm. Smaller ablation craters (< 10 mu m) can be subject to significant element fractionation during analysis, but the systematic relationship of such fractionation with glass composition suggests that analyses for some elements at these resolutions may be quantifiable. In undertaking analyses, either by microprobe or LA-ICP-MS, reference material data acquired using the same procedure, and preferably from the same analytical session, should be presented alongside new analytical data. In part 2 of the review, we describe, critically assess, and recommend ways in which tephras or cryptotephras can be correlated (in conjunction with other information) using numerical or statistical analyses of compositional data. Statistical methods provide a less subjective means of dealing with analytical data pertaining to tephra components (usually glass or crystalsiphenocrysts) than heuristic alternatives. They enable a better understanding of relationships among the data from multiple viewpoints to be developed and help quantify the degree of uncertainty in establishing correlations. In common with other scientific hypothesis testing, it is easier to infer using such analysis that two or more tephras are different rather than the same. Adding stratigraphic, chronological, spatial, or palaeoenvironmental data (i.e. multiple criteria) is usually necessary and allows for more robust correlations to be made. A two-stage approach is useful, the first focussed on differences in the mean composition of samples, or their range, which can be visualised graphically via scatterplot matrices or bivariate plots coupled with the use of statistical tools such as distance measures, similarity coefficients, hierarchical cluster analysis (informed by distance measures or similarity or cophenetic coefficients), and principal components analysis (PCA). Some statistical methods (cluster analysis, discriminant analysis) are referred to as 'machine learning' in the computing literature. The second stage examines sample variance and the degree of compositional similarity so that sample equivalence or otherwise can be established on a statistical basis. This stage may involve discriminant function analysis (DFA), support vector machines (SVMs), canonical variates analysis (CVA), and ANOVA or MANOVA (or its two-sample special case, the Hotelling two-sample T-2 test). Randomization tests can be used where distributional assumptions such as multivariate normality underlying parametric tests are doubtful. Compositional data may be transformed and scaled before being subjected to multivariate statistical procedures including calculation of distance matrices, hierarchical cluster analysis, and PCA. Such transformations may make the assumption of multivariate normality more appropriate. A sequential procedure using Mahalanobis distance and the Hotelling two-sample T-2 test is illustrated using glass major element data from trachytic to phonolitic Kenyan tephras. All these methods require a broad range of high-quality compositional data which can be used to compare 'unknowns' with reference (training) sets that are sufficiently complete to account for all possible correlatives, including tephras with heterogeneous glasses that contain multiple compositional groups. Currently, incomplete databases are tending to limit correlation efficacy. The development of an open, online global database to facilitate progress towards integrated, high-quality tephrostratigraphic frameworks for different regions is encouraged. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has become a powerful technology to support various applications such as collecting real-time aquatic information, naval military applications, maritime security, natural disaster prediction and control, archaeological expeditions, oil and gas exploration, shipwrecks discovery, water contamination, marine life observation and smart Ocean. IoUT is referred as smart intricately linked underwater objects to monitor these underwater operations. The IoUT framework incorporates several underwater communication technologies based on magnetic induction, optical signals, radio signals and acoustic waves. It is an emerging communication ecosystem which can reveal a new era of research, business and naval applications. It is a novel and vibrant paradigm for the Blue Economy sector bringing the ability to communicate autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), sensing, actuating and transferring this data to control centers using regular internet speeds through low cost technologies. It is anticipated to support future networking systems which can bring tremendous improvement in previous generations in terms of stable networking, high coverage, massive connectivity, low latency, high data rate and low power consumption. This study introduces the possible network framework of IoUT which is naturally heterogeneous and must be flexible enough to work under unpredicted ocean conditions. In this study, we examine channel models, routing protocols, networking topologies and simulation tools. Furthermore, we discussed recent advancements in IoUT in terms of smart devices, consumer electronics, communication and role of AUVs. In addition, edge computing, optical wireless communication (OWC), data analytics, blockchain, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) and machine learning were viewed as promising techniques to support IoUT. We have dedicated a complete section to applications of IoUT. Finally, numerous open research challenges and future directions were presented.

Here we compile the largest dataset of past diet derived from stable isotope delta C-13 parts per thousand and delta N-15 parts per thousand values in the Americas to quantitatively evaluate the impact of 7000 years of climatic and demographic change on dietary variation in the Central Andes. Specifically, we couple paleoclimatic data from a general circulation model with estimates of relative past population inferred from archaeologically derived radiocarbon dates to assess the influence of climate and population on spatiotemporal dietary variation using an ensemble machine learning model capable of accounting for interactions among predictors. Results reveal that climate and population strongly predict diet (80% of delta 15N parts per thousand and 66% of delta 13C parts per thousand) and that Central Andean diets correlate much more strongly with local climatic conditions than regional population size, indicating that the past 7000 years of dietary change was influenced more by climatic than socio-demographic processes. Visually, the temporal pattern suggests decreasing dietary variation across elevation zones during the Late Horizon, raising the possibility that sociopolitical factors overrode the influence of local climatic conditions on diet during that time. The overall findings and approach establish a general framework for understanding the influence of local climate and demography on dietary change across human history.";Wilson et al. - 2022 - Climate and demography drive 7000 years of dietary.txt

While disciplinary discretions exist, researchers commonly devise spatial, temporal, and organizational scales in scoping phenomena of interest and determining measurements and representational frameworks in research design. The rise of the Fourth Paradigm for science drives data-intensive computing without preconceived notions regarding at what scale the phenomena or processes of interest operate, or at which level of details meaningful patterns may emerge. While scale is the a priori consideration for theory-driven research to seek ontological and relational affirmations, big data analytics and machine learning embed scale in algorithms and model outputs.

NL8FJH6G;journalArticle;2020;"Ibrahim, Y; Nagy, B; Benedek, C";Deep Learning-Based Masonry Wall Image Analysis;REMOTE SENSING;In this paper we introduce a novel machine learning-based fully automatic approach for the semantic analysis and documentation of masonry wall images, performing in parallel automatic detection and virtual completion of occluded or damaged wall regions, and brick segmentation leading to an accurate model of the wall structure. For this purpose, we propose a four-stage algorithm which comprises three interacting deep neural networks and a watershed transform-based brick outline extraction step. At the beginning, a U-Net-based sub-network performs initial wall segmentation into brick, mortar and occluded regions, which is followed by a two-stage adversarial inpainting model. The first adversarial network predicts the schematic mortar-brick pattern of the occluded areas based on the observed wall structure, providing in itself valuable structural information for archeological and architectural applications. The second adversarial network predicts the pixels' color values yielding a realistic visual experience for the observer. Finally, using the neural network outputs as markers in a watershed-based segmentation process, we generate the accurate contours of the individual bricks, both in the originally visible and in the artificially inpainted wall regions. Note that while the first three stages implement a sequential pipeline, they interact through dependencies of their loss functions admitting the consideration of hidden feature dependencies between the different network components. For training and testing the network a new dataset has been created, and an extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation versus the state-of-the-art is given. The experiments confirmed that the proposed method outperforms the reference techniques both in terms of wall structure estimation and regarding the visual quality of the inpainting step, moreover it can be robustly used for various different masonry wall types.;Ibrahim et al. - 2020 - Deep Learning-Based Masonry Wall Image Analysis.txt

Animals or structures they build (e.g. nests) can be photointerpreted from these images, however, automated detection is required for more efficient surveys. We developed semi-automated analyses to map white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster) nests in VHR aerial photographs of the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia, an important breeding site for many seabird species. Nest detection is complicated by high environmental heterogeneity at the scale of nests (similar to 1-2 m), the presence of many features that resemble nests and the variability of nest size, shape and context. Finally, the rarity of nests limits the availability of training data. These challenges are not unique to wildlife surveys and we show how they can be overcome by an innovative integration of object-based image analyses (OBIA) and the powerful machine learning one-class classifier Maxent. Maxent classifications using features characterizing object texture, geometry and neighborhood, along with limited object color information, successfully identified over 90% of high quality nests (most weathered and unusually shaped nests were also detected, but at a slightly lower rate) and labeled <2% of objects as candidate nests. Although this overestimates the occurrence of nests, the results can be visually screened to rule out all but the most likely nests in a process that is simpler and more efficient than manual photointerpretation of the full image. Our study shows that semi-automated image analyses for wildlife surveys are achievable. Furthermore, the developed strategies have broad relevance to image processing applications that seek to detect rare features differing only subtly from a heterogeneous background, including remote sensing of archeological remains. We also highlight solutions to maximize the use of imperfect or uncalibrated image data, such as some UAV-based imagery and the growing body of VHR imagery available in Google Earth and other virtual globes.;Andrew et Shephard - 2017 - Semi-automated detection of eagle nests an applic.txt

Our results show that when properly trained, a deep learning model can assign types to digital images of decorated sherds with an accuracy comparable to, and sometimes higher than, four expert-level contemporary archaeologists. The technique also offers novel tools for visualizing both the importance of diagnostic design elements and overall design relationships between groups of pottery sherds. We demonstrate that this method can objectively match a specific unclassified sherd image to its most similar counterparts through a search of thousands of digital photos. This discovery has important archaeological implications for analyzing time relationships, monitoring stylistic trends, reconstructing fragmentary artifacts, identifying ancient artisans, and studying the evolution and spread of ancient technologies and styles.

A digital version of a mosaic can be useful for archaeologists, scholars and restorers who are interested in studying, comparing and preserving mosaics. Nowadays, archaeologists base their studies mainly on manual operation and visual observation that, although still fundamental, should be supported by an automatized procedure of information extraction. In this context, this research explains improvements which can change the manual and time-consuming procedure of mosaic tesserae drawing. More specifically, this paper analyses the advantages of using Mo.Se. (Mosaic Segmentation), an algorithm that exploits deep learning and image segmentation techniques; the methodology combines U-Net 3 Network with the Watershed algorithm. The final purpose is to define a workflow which establishes the steps to perform a robust segmentation and obtain a digital (vector) representation of a mosaic. The detailed approach is presented, and theoretical justifications are provided, building various connections with other models, thus making the workflow both theoretically valuable and practically scalable for medium or large datasets. The automatic segmentation process was tested with the high-resolution orthoimage of an ancient mosaic by following a close-range photogrammetry procedure. Our approach has been tested in the pavement of St. Stephen's Church in Umm ar-Rasas, a Jordan archaeological site, located 30 km southeast of the city of Madaba (Jordan). Experimental results show that this generalized framework yields good performances, obtaining higher accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Mo.Se. has been validated using publicly available datasets as a benchmark, demonstrating that the combination of learning-based methods with procedural ones enhances segmentation performance in terms of overall accuracy, which is almost 10% higher.

We have tested the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated remote sensing detection of archaeological features. Our case study is the qanat systems of the Erbil Plain in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The signature of the underground qanat systems on the remote sensing data are the semi-circular openings of their vertical shafts.

However, conventional methods rely heavily on visual interpretation by archaeologists and RS specialists, which are difficult to handle the large amount of archaeological traces in massive RS data. Especially for large-scale linear archaeological sites, such as the Great Wall, it is challenging to obtain systematic and complete identification results through human-computer interpretation. Based on the theory of deep learning, we propose an improved DeepLabv3+ model and conduct a typical application of the Great Wall of the Han dynasty (GWH) in northwest (NW) China using very high-resolution (VHR) aerial imagery. The main improvements of the DeepLabv3+ model were (1) replacing the encoder module with pre-trained ResNet101 to obtain deeper features, and (2) adding the Dice coefficient to the loss function to improve the accuracy under the unbalanced condition of positive and negative samples. The experimental evaluation reveals that the improved DeepLabv3+ model achieved accuracy of 98.37%, recall of 98.92%, F1 of 98.64%, and intersection over union (IoU) of 97.32%. Compared with the original model, accuracy, recall, F1, and IoU have improved by 9.03%, 9.13%, 9.08%, and 16.22%, respectively. Furthermore, the identification results in the test area also indicate that the improved model has good transferability. This study provides an automatic approach for surveying and mapping the GWH and indicates the great potential of deep learning in the identification of linear archaeological traces in RS archaeology.;Yang et al. - 2022 - Auto-identification of linear archaeological trace.txt

How to efficiently extract useful knowledge from the massive unstructured archaeological site texts is of great significance for the mining and reuse of archaeological information. According to the site information (such as name, location, cultural type, dynasty, etc.) recorded in the Chinese archaeological site text, this paper combines deep learning and natural language processing techniques to study the information extraction method for automatically obtaining the spatio-temporal information of sites. The initial construction of the corpus of Chinese archaeological site text is completed for the first time, and the corpus is input into the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with Conditional Random Fields (BiLSTM-CRF) entity recognition model and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units with Dual Attention (BiGRU-Dual Attention) relationship extraction model for training. The F1 values of BiLSTM-CRF model and BiGRU-Dual Attention model on the test set reach 87.87% and 88.05%, respectively. The study demonstrates that the information extraction method proposed in this paper is feasible for the Chinese archaeological site texts, which promotes the establishment of knowledge graphs in archaeology and provides new methods and ideas for the development of information mining technology in archaeology.;Yuan et al. - 2022 - Extracting Spatio-Temporal Information from Chines.txt

Archaeologists nowadays conduct surface survey equipped with navigation devices counting, documenting, and collecting surface archaeological potsherds within a set of plotted grids. Recent advancements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and image processing analysis can be utilised to support such surface archaeological investigations. In this study, we have implemented two different artificial intelligence image processing methods over two areas of interest near the present-day village of Kophinou in Cyprus, in the Xeros River valley. We have applied a random forest classifier through the Google Earth Engine big data cloud platform and a Single Shot Detector neural network in the ArcGIS Pro environment. For the first case study, the detection was based on red-green-blue (RGB) high-resolution orthophotos. In contrast, a multispectral camera covering both the visible and the near-infrared parts of the spectrum was used in the second area of investigation. The overall results indicate that such an approach can be used in the future as part of ongoing archaeological pedestrian surveys to detect scattered potsherds in areas of archaeological interest, even if pottery shares a very high spectral similarity with the surface.;Agapiou et al. - 2021 - Detection of Archaeological Surface Ceramics Using.txt

Most of the current convolutional neural network (CNN) object-oriented detection techniques are based on a faster region-based CNN (R-CNN) and other one-stage detectors that often lack adequate processing speeds and detection accuracies. Recently, the two-stage detector Mask R-CNN technique achieved impressive results in object detection and instance segmentation problems and was successfully applied in the analysis of archaeological airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. In this study, we outline a modified Mask R-CNN technique that reliably and efficiently detects relict charcoal hearth (RCH) sites on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data-based digital elevation models (DEMs). Using image augmentation and image preprocessing steps combined with the deep learning-based adaptive gradient method with a dynamic bound on the learning rate (AdaBound) optimization technique, we could improve the model's accuracy and significantly reduce its training time. We use DEMs based on high-resolution LiDAR data and the visualization for archaeological topography (VAT) technique that give images with a very strong contrast of the terrain and the outline of the sites of interest in the North German Lowland. Therefore, the model can identify RCH sites with an average recall of 83% and an average precision of 87%. Techniques such as the modified Mask R-CNN method outlined here will help to greatly improve our knowledge about archaeological site densities in the realm of historical charcoal production and past human-landscape interactions. This method provides an accurate, time-efficient and bias-free large-scale site mapping option not only for the North German Lowland but potentially for other landscapes as well.;Bonhage et al. - 2021 - A modified Mask region-based convolutional neural .txt

Maps produced before the expansion of large-scale mechanized agriculture reflect a landscape that is lost today. Of particular interest to us is the great quantity of archaeologically relevant information that these maps recorded, both deliberately and incidentally. Despite the importance of the information they contain, researchers have only recently begun to automatically digitize and extract data from such maps as coherent information, rather than manually examine a raster image. However, these new approaches have focused on specific types of information that cannot be used directly for archaeological or heritage purposes. This paper provides a proof of concept of the application of deep learning techniques to extract archaeological information from historical maps in an automated manner. Early twentieth century colonial map series have been chosen, as they provide enough time depth to avoid many recent large-scale landscape modifications and cover very large areas (comprising several countries). The use of common symbology and conventions enhance the applicability of the method. The results show deep learning to be an efficient tool for the recovery of georeferenced, archaeologically relevant information that is represented as conventional signs, line-drawings and text in historical maps. The method can provide excellent results when an adequate training dataset has been gathered and is therefore at its best when applied to the large map series that can supply such information. The deep learning approaches described here open up the possibility to map sites and features across entire map series much more quickly and coherently than other available methods, opening up the potential to reconstruct archaeological landscapes at continental scales.;Garcia-Molsosa et al. - 2021 - Potential of deep learning segmentation for the ex.txt

The recent emergence of national scale remotely sensed datasets has created the potential to greatly increase the rate of analysis and recording of cultural heritage sites. However, the time and resources required to process these datasets in traditional desktop surveys presents a near insurmountable challenge. The use of artificial intelligence to carry out preliminary processing of vast areas could enable experts to prioritize their prospection focus; however, success so far has been hindered by the lack of large training datasets in this field. This study develops an innovative transfer learning approach, utilizing a deep convolutional neural network initially trained on Lunar LiDAR datasets and reapplied here in an archaeological context. Recall rates of 80% and 83% were obtained on the 0.5 m and 0.25 m resolution datasets respectively, with false positive rates maintained below 20%. These results are state of the art and demonstrate that this model is an efficient, effective tool for semi-automated object detection for this type of archaeological objects.

Supplementary to their location, the propagation velocity of electromagnetic waves in the subsurface can be derived. In recent years, it was shown that deep learning tools can automatically detect hyperbola in radargrams using data measured over urban infrastructure, which are relatively clear. In contrast, in this study, we used an archaeological dataset with diverse underground structures. In the first step we used the deep learning network RetinaNet to detect hyperbola automatically and achieved an average precision of 0.58. In the next step, 10 different approaches for hyperbola fitting and thus velocity determination were applied. The derived information was validated with manually determined velocities and apex points. It was shown that hyperbola extraction by using a threshold and a column connection clustering (C3) algorithm followed by simple hyperbola fitting is the best method, which had a mean velocity error of 0.021 m/ns compared to manual determination.

Spatial interpretation of numerous objects with various shapes and sizes is a difficult challenge for archaeologists. Mapping structures with multiple elements whose area can exceed dozens of hectares, such as ancient agricultural field systems, is very time-consuming. These archaeological sites are composed of a large number of embanked fields, which together form a recognizable spatial pattern. Image classification and segmentation, as well as object recognition, are the most important tasks for deep learning neural networks (DLNN) and therefore they can be used for automatic recognition of archaeological monuments. In this study, a U-Net neural network was implemented to perform semantic segmentation of the ALS-derived data including (1) archaeological, (2) natural and (3) modern features in the Polish part of the Bialowieza Forest. The performance of the U-Net segmentation model was evaluated by measuring the pixel-wise similarity between ground truth and predicted segmentation masks. After 83 epochs, The Dice-Sorensen coefficient (F1 score) and the Intersect Over Union (IoU) metrics were 0.58 and 0.5, respectively. The IoU metric reached a value of 0.41, 0.62 and 0.62 for the ancient field system banks, ancient field system plots and burial mounds, respectively. The results of the U-Net deep learning model proved very useful in semantic segmentation of images derived from ALS data.;Banasiak et al. - 2022 - Semantic Segmentation (U-Net) of Archaeological Fe.txt

Deep neural models have been able to perform image-to-image translation by transferring pictorial styles, coloring old photographs or filling in missing parts. This last technique is known as image inpainting and enables restoration of damaged or missing parts of an image or photograph to obtain the complete picture. However, it is not always possible to properly define which parts are missing or to identify where they are missing, as in the case of superimposing new information on an already complete image. In this paper, we propose the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs), a well-known deep learning model, for virtual inpainting restoration of artificial landscape images containing archaeological remains of Greek temples. The network identifies key features determined by the internal logic of the architectural style denoted by the ruins and adds the missing architectural elements to obtain an image of the restored building. Unlike other studies, it does not receive any information on which elements should be added or where. Virtual inpainting restoration is capable of representing a building's envelope but also integrates particular aspects of the building related to the architectural language used for its design. The restoration of the fundamental parts of the classical Greek order was consistent, and the results were evaluated with objective metrics and through a subjective survey between academics and architects. They showed that adding segmented images to the training dataset gives better results.;Nogales et al. - 2021 - ARQGAN An evaluation of generative adversarial ne.txt

I analyze feminized artificial intelligence (Siri, Alexa, Cortana) in light of two science-fiction narratives: Tomorrow's Eve, a Victorian novel; and Her, a postmillennial film. Each story exemplifies a pivotal moment in media history: Eve the transition from symbolic to technical media; Her the transition from technical to computational media. Both stories depict a man falling in love with an artificially intelligent, feminized version of the communication media du jour. Whereas Eve and Her operate on our imaginary, Siri, Alexa, and Cortana are by our side every day, naturalizing contingent gender divisions. I address three questions: what is the cultural work accomplished by feminized AI? Which boundaries are coming down or built up? What gendered relations are (re)produced? Drawing on media archaeology, critical theory, gender studies, and media theory, this article argues the association of femininity with technology sustains differences across three dimensions: docile labour, replaceable embodiment, and artificial intelligence. This triadic framework weaves together analytic threads that often remain separate to develop a nuanced critique of femininity as a mode for domesticating new technology and technology as materializing gender relations. The discussion extends the framework to a more generalized analysis of AI as a problematic prescription for how we become machine-shaped. I advance an entangled reinterpretation of the Turing Test and suggest ethics, aesthetics, and performativity as key sites of intervention in rethinking AI design to include rather than exclude multiple forms of difference. The conclusion offers the framework as a novel heuristic for intersectional, nonreductive critiques of technology and difference.";09502386.2019.1671469.txt

An artificial intelligence approach;MEDITERRANEAN ARCHAEOLOGY & ARCHAEOMETRY;"Why archaeological artefacts are the way they are? In this paper we try to solve such a question by investigating the relationship between form and function. We propose new ways of studying the way behaviour in the past can be asserted on the examination of archaeological observables in the present. In any case, we take into account that there are also non-visual features characterizing ancient objects and materials (i.e., compositional information based on mass spectrometry data, chronological information based on radioactive decay measurements, etc.). Information that should make us aware of many functional properties of objects is multidimensional in nature: size, which makes reference to height, length, depth, weight and mass; shape and form, which make reference to the geometry of contours and volumes; texture, which refers to the microtopography (roughness, waviness, and lay) and visual appearance (colour variations, brightness, reflectivity and transparency) of surfaces; and finally material, meaning the combining of distinct compositional elements and properties to form a whole. With the exception of material data, the other relevant aspects for functional reasoning have been traditionally described in rather ambiguous terms, without taking into account the advantages of quantitative measurements of shape/form, and texture. Reasoning about the functionality of archaeological objects recovered at the archaeological site requires a cross-disciplinary investigation, which may also range from recognition techniques used in computer vision and robotics to reasoning, representation, and learning methods in artificial intelligence. The approach we adopt here is to follow current computational theories of object perception to ameliorate the way archaeology can deal with the explanation of human behaviour in the past (function) from the analysis of visual and non-visual data, taking into account that visual appearances and even compositional characteristics only constrain the way an object may be used, but never fully determine it.";Barcelo et de Almeida - 2012 - Functional analysis from visual and non-visual dat.txt

On the other hand, the reliable crossover standard from different biological information sources can decrease local random errors of alternative treatment.

We try to develop an integrated system for archaeological 3D survey and all other types of archaeological data and knowledge by incorporating observable (material) and non-graphic (interpretive) data. Survey plays a central role, since it is both a metric representation of the archaeological site and, to a wider extent, an interpretation of it (being also a common basis for communication between the two teams). More specifically, 3D survey is crucial, allowing archaeologists to connect actual spatial assets to the stratigraphic formation processes (i.e., to the archaeological time) and to translate spatial observations into historical interpretation of the site. It is well known that laser scanner, photogrammetry and computer vision are very useful tools for archaeologists, although the integration of the representation of space, as well as archaeological time has not yet found a methodological standard of reference. We propose a common formalism for describing photogrammetric survey and archaeological knowledge stemming from ontologies: indeed, ontologies are fully used to model and store 3D data and archaeological knowledge. We equip this formalism with a qualitative representation of time, starting from archaeological stratigraphy. Stratigraphic analyses (both of excavated deposits and of upstanding structures) are closely related to Edward Cecil Harris's theory of the \Unit of Stratigraphication\"" (referred to as \""US\"", while a stratigraphic unit of an upstanding structure Unita Stratigrafica Murale, in Italian, will be referred to as \""USM\""). Every US is connected to the others by geometric, topological and, eventually, temporal links, and these are recorded by the 3D photogrammetric survey. However, the limitations of the Harris matrix approach led us to use another formalism for representing stratigraphic relationships, namely Qualitative Constraints Networks (QCN), which was successfully used in the domain of knowledge representation and reasoning in artificial intelligence for representing temporal relations.""";Drap et al. - 2017 - Ontology-Based Photogrammetry Survey for Medieval .txt

We present an overview of examples of these models in the life sciences, economics, planning, sociology, and archaeology. We conclude that ABMs strongly tend towards an individualist view of the social world. This point is reinforced by closer consideration of particular examples. This discussion pays attention to the inadequacy of an individualist model of society with reference to debates in social theory. We argue that because models are closed representations of an open world it is important that institutions and other social structures be explicitly included, or that their omission be explained. A tentative explanation for the bias of ABMs is offered, based on an examination of early research in artificial intelligence and distributed artificial intelligence from which disciplines the approach is derived. Some implications of these findings are discussed. We indicate some useful research directions which are beginning to tackle the individualism issue directly. We further note that the underlying assumptions of ABMs are often hidden in the implementation details. We conclude that such models must be subject to critical examination of their assumptions, and that model builders should engage with social theory if the approach is to realise its full potential.;O'Sullivan et Haklay - 2000 - Agent-based models and individualism is the world.txt

As access to computing technology has increased over time, the breadth of computer-assisted methods in archaeology has also increased. This proliferation has provided us a considerable toolset towards engaging both new and longstanding questions, especially as interdisciplinary collaboration between archaeologists, computer scientists, and engineers continues to grow. As an example of an archaeological project engaging in computer-based approaches, the Guadalupe/Colon Archaeological Project is presented as a case study. Project applications and methodologies range from the regional-scale identification of sites using a geographic information system (GIS) or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) down to the microscopic scale of classifying ceramic materials with convolutional neural networks. Methods relating to the 3D modeling of sites, features, and artifacts and the benefits therein are also explored.

While numerous techniques already exist for the detection of carnivore activity in archaeological and palaeontological sites, many of these techniques present important limitations. The present study builds on a number of advanced data science techniques to confront these issues, defining methods for the identification of the precise agents involved in carcass consumption and manipulation. For the purpose of this study, a large sample of 620 carnivore tooth pits is presented, including samples from bears, hyenas, jaguars, leopards, lions, wolves, foxes and African wild dogs. Using 3D modelling, geometric morphometrics, robust data modelling, and artificial intelligence algorithms, the present study obtains between 88 and 98% accuracy, with balanced overall evaluation metrics across all datasets. From this perspective, and when combined with other sources of taphonomic evidence, these results show that advanced data science techniques can be considered a valuable addition to the taphonomist's toolkit for the identification of precise carnivore agents via tooth pit morphology.;Courtenay et al. - 2021 - Developments in data science solutions for carnivo.txt

JZBWCDUZ;journalArticle;2022;"Argyrou, Argyro; Agapiou, Athos";A Review of Artificial Intelligence and Remote Sensing for Archaeological Research;Remote Sensing;The documentation and protection of archaeological and cultural heritage (ACH) using remote sensing, a non-destructive tool, is increasingly popular for experts around the world, as it allows rapid searching and mapping at multiple scales, rapid analysis of multi-source data sets, and dynamic monitoring of ACH sites and their environments. The exploitation of remote sensing data and their products have seen an increased use in recent years in the fields of archaeological science and cultural heritage. Different spatial and spectral analysis datasets have been applied to distinguish archaeological remains and detect changes in the landscape over time, and, in the last decade, archaeologists have adopted more thoroughly automated object detection approaches for potential sites. These approaches included, among others, object detection methods, such as those of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, as well as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep learning (DL) models using aerial and satellite images, airborne and spaceborne remote sensing (ASRS), multispectral, hyperspectral images, and active methods (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging radar (LiDAR)). Researchers also refer to the potential for archaeologists to explore such artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in various ways, such as identifying archaeological features and classifying them. Here, we present a review study related to the contributions of remote sensing (RS) and artificial intelligence in archaeology. However, a main question remains open in the field of research: the rate of positive contribution of remote sensing and artificial intelligence techniques in archaeological research. The scope of this study is to summarize the state of the art related to AI and RS for archaeological research and provide some further insights into the existing literature.;Argyrou et Agapiou - 2022 - A Review of Artificial Intelligence and Remote Sen.txt

The intent is to provide specialists with a GUI-based tool that can apply annotation used for training for neural network models, enable training and development of segmentation models, and allow classification of imagery data to facilitate auto-discovery of features. The tool is generic and can be used for a variety of settings, although the tool was tested using datasets from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Iran, Iraq, and Jordan. Current outputs suggest that trained data are able to help identify ruined structures, that is, structures such as burials, exposed building ruins, and other surface features that are in some degraded state. Additionally, qanat(s), or ancient underground channels having surface access holes, and mounded sites, which have distinctive hill-shaped features, are also identified. Other classes are also possible, and the tool helps users make their own training-based approach and feature identification classes. To improve accuracy, we strongly urge greater publication of UAV imagery data by projects using open journal publications and public repositories.

The presence of trees and undergrowth makes the reconnaissance of archaeological features and remains very difficult, while the erosion, increased by slope, tends to adversely affect the microtopographical features of potential archaeological interest, thus making them hardly identifiable. For the purpose of our investigations, a UAV LiDAR survey has been carried out at Perticara (located in Basilicata southern Italy), an abandoned medieval village located in a geologically fragile area, characterized by complex topography, strong erosion, and a dense forest cover. All of these characteristics pose serious challenge issues and make this site particularly significant and attractive for the setting and testing of an optimal LiDAR-based approach to analyze hilly forested regions searching for subtle archaeological features. The LiDAR based investigations were based on three steps: (i) field data acquisition and data pre-processing, (ii) data post-processing, and (iii) semi-automatic feature extraction method based on machine learning and local statistics. The results obtained from the LiDAR based analyses successfully confirmed by the field survey) made it possible to identify the lost medieval village that represents an emblematic case of settlement abandoned during the crisis of the late Middle Ages that affected most regions in southern Italy.;Masini et al. - 2022 - UAV LiDAR Based Approach for the Detection and Int.txt

Telluric artifacts, imperfect line lists, inexact continuum placement, and inflexible models frustrate the scientific promise of these information-rich data sets. Here we debut an interpretable machine-learning framework blase that addresses these and other challenges. The semiempirical approach can be viewed as \transfer learning\""-first pretraining models on noise-free precomputed synthetic spectral models, then learning the corrections to line depths and widths from whole-spectrum fitting to an observed spectrum. The auto-differentiable model employs back-propagation, the fundamental algorithm empowering modern deep learning and neural networks. Here, however, the 40,000+ parameters symbolize physically interpretable line profile properties such as amplitude, width, location, and shape, plus radial velocity and rotational broadening. This hybrid data-/model-driven framework allows joint modeling of stellar and telluric lines simultaneously, a potentially transformative step forward for mitigating the deleterious telluric contamination in the near-infrared. The blase approach acts as both a deconvolution tool and semiempirical model. The general-purpose scaffolding may be extensible to many scientific applications, including precision radial velocities, Doppler imaging, chemical abundances for Galactic archeology, line veiling, magnetic fields, and remote sensing. Its sparse-matrix architecture and GPU acceleration make blase fast. The open-source PyTorch-based code blase includes tutorials, Application Programming Interface documentation, and more.

The research is based on the Joconde database maintained by the French Ministry of Culture that contains illustrated artwork records from main French public and private museums representing archeological objects, decorative arts, fine arts, historical and scientific documents, etc. The Joconde database includes semantic metadata that describes properties of the artworks and their content. The developed methods create a data pipeline that processes metadata, trains a Convolutional Neural Network image classification model, makes prediction for the entire collection and expands the metadata to be the base for the SPARQL search queries. We developed a set of such queries to identify noise and silence in the human annotations and to search image content with results ranked according to the relevance of the objects quantified by the prediction score provided by the deep learning model. We also developed methods to discover new contextual relationships between the concepts in the metadata by analyzing the contrast between the concepts' similarities in the Joconde's semantic model and other vocabularies and we tried to improve the model prediction scores based on the semantic relations. Our results show that cross-fertilization between symbolic AI and machine learning can indeed provide the tools to address the challenges of the museum curators work describing the artwork pieces and searching for the relevant images.;Bobasheva et al. - 2022 - Learning and Reasoning for Cultural Metadata Quali.txt

The information database of archaeological sites of South- Eastern Altai was created based on literary sources, the authors' own field research. Schemes of distribution of archaeological sites according to some landscape features: absolute height; position in relation to watercourses; slopes; exposition; solar radiation intensity in June; Intensities of solar radiation for December was created on the basis of geoinformation analysis of the relief of the territory and the available archaeological data. The obtained statistical regularities of the distribution of archaeological sites in the landscapes of South-Eastern Altai were the basis for the creation and verification of the algorithm of a machine-learning model - a neural network. Based on the results, a forecast map of the location of archaeological sites was created. The greatest probability of discovering new archaeological objects could be provided by the following landscape parameters, no further than 500-600 m from the river with a slope steepness of up to 4 degrees, with high intensity and summer ( June) solar radiation and with an exposure of slopes: southern, south-eastern and western. Unexplored archaeological sites in South-East Altai are most likely located along river valleys in the middle and lower reaches, at the confluence of rivers, along the periphery of intermountain basins, or on wide flat areas of above-floodplain terraces of river valleys.

This identification, based on phytolith wave pattern, is made using a pretrained VGG19 deep learning model. This approach has been tested in three key phytolith genera for the study of agricultural origins in Near East archaeology: Avena, Hordeum and Triticum. Also, this classification has been validated at species-level using Triticum boeoticum and dicoccoides images. Due to the diversity of microscopes, cameras and chemical treatments that can influence images of phytolith slides, three types of data augmentation techniques have been implemented: rotation of the images at 45-degree angles, random colour and brightness jittering, and random blur/sharpen. The implemented workflow has resulted in an overall accuracy of 93.68% for phytolith genera, improving previous attempts. The algorithm has also demonstrated its potential to automatize the classification of phytoliths species with an overall accuracy of 100%.

Valuable physical and chemical information can be obtained through scientific micro damage analysis of precious pottery, which plays a positive role in the protection of ceramics and archaeological research. In this study, LIBS spectroscopy combined with sequential backward selection-random forest regression (SBS-RFR) algorithm was proposed for simultaneous quantitative analysis of multi-elements in ceramic samples. Firstly, the experimental conditions for LIBS spectrum acquisition of ceramic samples were optimized, including delay time, laser pulse energy and cumulative times, and the characteristic emission lines of typical elements in LIBS spectra of ceramic samples were identified based on national institute of standards and technology (NIST) database. Four different spectral preprocessing methods are used to preprocess LIBS spectral data to find a better preprocessing method. And then, SBS algorithm is applied to eliminate irrelevant or redundant feature variables of LIBS spectrum. SBS-RFR calibration model is constructed based on the screened input variables to realize the rapid determination of multi-element content of ceramic samples. To further verify the prediction performance of the SBS-RFR calibration model, its prediction performance is compared with several other models. The results show that SBS-RFR model has better prediction performance than partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest regression (RFR), of which the R-2 values of prediction set are all over or close 0.98, and the RMSE values for Mg, Al, Ca and Fe are 0.3954%, 0.4627%, 0.2532% and 0.3791% respectively.

In this respect, machine learning (ML) works similar to typology. ML approaches are often deployed because it is thought that they reduce biases. However, biases are introduced into the process at many points, e.g., feature selection. In a project applying ML to Scandinavian rock art data, it was noticed that the algorithm struggles with classifying certain motifs correctly. This contribution discusses the consistency in applying biases by ML in contrast to the inconsistency of human classification. It is argued that it is necessary to bring machines and humans into a meaningful dialogue attempting to understand why apparent \misclassifications \"" happen. This is important to inform us about the classification output, our biases, and the rock art data, which are in themself inconsistent, ambiguous, and biased because they are the outcomes of human creativity.

However, manual labelling on low-quality monochromatic historical orthophotos for semantic segmentation (pixel-level classification) is particularly challenging and time consuming. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology for the automated extraction of very-high-resolution (VHR) multi-class LC maps from historical orthophotos under the absence of target-specific ground truth annotations. The methodology builds on recent evolutions in deep learning, leveraging domain adaptation and transfer learning. First, an unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation between a source domain (recent RGB image of high quality, annotations available) and the target domain (historical monochromatic image of low quality, no annotations available) is learned using a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN). Second, a state-of-the-art fully convolutional network (FCN) for semantic segmentation is pre-trained on a large annotated RGB earth observation (EO) dataset that is converted to the target domain using the I2I function. Third, the FCN is fine-tuned using self-annotated data on a recent RGB orthophoto of the study area under consideration, after conversion using again the I2I function. The methodology is tested on a new custom dataset: the 'Sagalassos historical land cover dataset', which consists of three historical monochromatic orthophotos (1971, 1981, 1992) and one recent RGB orthophoto (2015) of VHR (0.3-0.84 m GSD) all capturing the same greater area around Sagalassos archaeological site (Turkey), and corresponding manually created annotations (2.7 km(2) per orthophoto) distinguishing 14 different LC classes. Furthermore, a comprehensive overview of open-source annotated EO datasets for multiclass semantic segmentation is provided, based on which an appropriate pretraining dataset can be selected. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is effective, increasing the mean intersection over union by 27.2% when using domain adaptation, and by 13.0% when using domain pretraining, and that transferring weights from a model pretrained on a dataset closer to the target domain is preferred.;van den Broeck et al. - 2022 - Multiclass Land Cover Mapping from Historical Orth.txt

The workshop's plenary lectures were on: i)  viral pandemics and epidemics in the ancient Mediterranean; ii) the impact of  obesity on the outcome of viral infections in children and adolescents; and iii)  COVID-19 and artificial intelligence. Despite the scarcity of evidence from  fossils and remnants, viruses have been recognised as significant causes of  several epidemics in the ancient Mediterranean. Paediatric obesity, a modifiable  critical health risk factor, has been shown to impact on the development,  progression and severity of viral infections. Thus, the prevention of paediatric  obesity should be included in formulating public health policies and  decision-making strategies against emerging global viral threats. During the  current COVID-19 pandemic, artificial intelligence has been used to facilitate  the identification, monitoring and prevention of SARS-CoV-2. In the future, it  will play a fundamental role in the surveillance of epidemic-prone infectious  diseases, in the repurposing of older therapies and in the design of novel  therapeutic agents against viral infections.
