6KQRQFDA;journalArticle;2012;"Menze, Bjoern H.; Ur, Jason A.";Mapping patterns of long-term settlement in Northern Mesopotamia at a large scale;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences;The landscapes of the Near East show both the first settlements and the longest trajectories of settlement systems. Mounding is a characteristic property of these settlement sites, resulting from millennia of continuing settlement activity at distinguished places. So far, however, this defining feature of ancient settlements has not received much attention, or even been the subject of systematic evaluation. We propose a remote sensing approach for comprehensively mapping the pattern of human settlement at large scale and establish the largest archaeological record for a landscape in Mesopotamia, mapping about 14,000 settlement sites—spanning eight millennia—at 15-m resolution in a 23,000-km               2               area in northeastern Syria. To map both low- and high-mounded places—the latter of which are often referred to as “tells”—we develop a strategy for detecting anthrosols in time series of multispectral satellite images and measure the volume of settlement sites in a digital elevation model. Using this volume as a proxy to continued occupation, we find a dependency of the long-term attractiveness of a site on local water availability, but also a strong relation to the relevance within a basin-wide exchange network that we can infer from our record and third millennium B.C. intersite routes visible on the ground until recent times. We believe it is possible to establish a nearly comprehensive map of human settlements in the fluvial plains of northern Mesopotamia and beyond, and site volume may be a key quantity to uncover long-term trends in human settlement activity from such a record.;Menze et Ur - 2012 - Mapping patterns of long-term settlement in Northe.txt
NDXJ4F8X;journalArticle;2006;"Menze, B.H.; Ur, J.A.; Sherratt, A.G.";Detection of Ancient Settlement Mounds;Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing;In the present study we demonstrate the value of the SRTM three arcsecond terrain model for a virtual survey of archae-ological sites: the detection and mapping of ancient settle-ment mounds in the Near East. These so-called “tells” are the result of millennia of occupation within the period from 8000–1000 BC, and form visible landmarks of the world’s first farming and urban communities. The SRTM model provides for the first time an opportunity to scan areas not yet surveyed archaeologically on a supra-regional scale and to pinpoint probable tell sites. In order to map these historic monuments for the purpose of settlement-study and conser-vation, we develop a machine learning classifier which identifies probable tell sites from the terrain model. In a test, point-like elevations of a characteristic tell shape, standing out for more than 5 to 6 m in the DEM were successfully detected (85/133 tells). False positives (327/(600*1200) pixels) were primarily due to natural elevations, resembling tells in height and size.;MENZE_2006.txt
J2VVMA3G;journalArticle;2020;"Zheng, Minrui; Tang, Wenwu; Ogundiran, Akinwumi; Yang, Jianxin";Spatial Simulation Modeling of Settlement Distribution Driven by Random Forest: Consideration of Landscape Visibility;Sustainability;Settlement models help to understand the social–ecological functioning of landscape and associated land use and land cover change. One of the issues of settlement modeling is that models are typically used to explore the relationship between settlement locations and associated influential factors (e.g., slope and aspect). However, few studies in settlement modeling adopted landscape visibility analysis. Landscape visibility provides useful information for understanding human decision-making associated with the establishment of settlements. In the past years, machine learning algorithms have demonstrated their capabilities in improving the performance of the settlement modeling and particularly capturing the nonlinear relationship between settlement locations and their drivers. However, simulation models using machine learning algorithms in settlement modeling are still not well studied. Moreover, overfitting issues and optimization of model parameters are major challenges for most machine learning algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we sought to pursue two research objectives. First, we aimed to evaluate the contribution of viewsheds and landscape visibility to the simulation modeling of - settlement locations. The second objective is to examine the performance of the machine learning algorithm-based simulation models for settlement location studies. Our study region is located in the metropolitan area of Oyo Empire, Nigeria, West Africa, ca. AD 1570–1830, and its pre-Imperial antecedents, ca. AD 1360–1570. We developed an event-driven spatial simulation model enabled by random forest algorithm to represent dynamics in settlement systems in our study region. Experimental results demonstrate that viewsheds and landscape visibility may offer more insights into unveiling the underlying mechanism that drives settlement locations. Random forest algorithm, as a machine learning algorithm, provide solid support for establishing the relationship between settlement occurrences and their drivers.;Zheng et al. - 2020 - Spatial Simulation Modeling of Settlement Distribu.txt

This work presents an account of a metric learning-based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to an archaeological dataset. The proposed account speaks of three stages: training, testing/validating, and community detection. Several thousand artefact images, ranging from the Lower Palaeolithic period (1.4 million years ago) to the Late Islamic period (fourteenth century AD), were used to train the model (i.e., the CNN), to discern artefacts by site and period. After training, it attained a comparable accuracy to archaeologists in various periods. In order to test the model, it was called to identify new query images according to similarities with known (training) images. Validation blinding experiments showed that while archaeologists performed as well as the model within their field of expertise, they fell behind concerning other periods. Lastly, a community detection algorithm based on the confusion matrix data was used to discern affiliations across sites. A case-study on Levantine Natufian artefacts demonstrated the algorithm’s capacity to discern meaningful connections. As such, the model has the potential to reveal yet unknown patterns in archaeological data.;Resler et al. - 2021 - A deep-learning model for predictive archaeology a.txt

ZZX9YIZM;journalArticle;2021;"Arnay, Rafael; Hernández-Aceituno, Javier; Mallol, Carolina";Soil micromorphological image classification using deep learning: The porosity parameter;Applied Soft Computing;Identifying components and microstructures in soil and sediment thin sections is one of the many subjects of analysis in archeological research, as these features can provide information regarding the deposit from which they were extracted, such as its origin and nature, clues about their associated human contexts or alteration processes they might have undergone over time. This article presents a Deep Learning system based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify different porosity types of structures in photomicrographs from archeological soils and sediment thin sections, as a first step to build and expand a database that will boost research in this field of archeological research. The results obtained are encouraging and show that the presented models can be successfully applied to this classification task.

In the Reading Images for the Cultural Heritage ( RICH) project, a variety of methods have been developed to support archaeologists in the visualization, categorization, and characterization of archaeological objects, such as medieval glass, coins, ceramics, and seeds. The methods are based on image processing and machine learning algorithms that are tailored to the task at hand.

EIJYJ4R5;journalArticle;2014;"Hörr, Christian; Lindinger, Elisabeth; Brunnett, Guido";Machine Learning Based Typology Development in Archaeology;Acm Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage;Formalizing and objectifying the process of artefact classification is an old wish of many archaeologists. On the other hand, data mining in general and machine learning in particular have already inspired many disciplines to introduce new paradigms of data analysis and knowledge discovery. Hence, this article aims for reviving the Typological Debate by adapting approved methods from other fields of science to archaeological data. To this end, we extensively discuss the concept of similarity and assess the suitability of machine learning techniques for the purposes of classification and typology development. Our methodology covers all steps starting from unordered, unlabelled objects to the emergence of a consistent and reusable typology. The application of this process is exemplarily illustrated by classifying the vessels from a Late Bronze Age cemetery in Eastern Saxony. Despite the individual character of these vessels, we achieved class prediction rates of more than 95%. Such a success was only possible, because we permanently reconciled the output of the learning algorithms with our own expectations in order to identify and eliminate the systematic errors within the typology.;2533988.txt

Y8DP5AA5;journalArticle;2015;"Oonk, Stijn; Spijker, Job";A supervised machine-learning approach towards geochemical predictive modelling in archaeology;Journal of Archaeological Science;In this work, data fusion of multi-element XRF results from archaeological feature soils and regional background soils was applied to assess the complementary value of geochemistry and machine-learning on predictive modelling in archaeology. Our principal aim was to integrate multiple data sources, train learning models for classification of archaeological soils and background soils, and compare model predictions for three validation areas with current archaeological interpretation and established predictive models. This was done using three supervised machine-learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines and artificial neural networks) which were trained, cross-validated and tested. The validation areas included a high archaeological potential area (n = 247 samples), the Dutch province of Zeeland (n = 261 samples) and an excavated imprint of an ancient farmhouse (n = 38 samples). The predictive models showed good overall performance and correctly classified about 95% of all test instances. According to the learning models, the first validation site has a top soil horizon that shows limited parallels with archaeological horizons used in model training, whereas features of high archaeological probability become more apparent below this horizon. This is in good correspondence with geochemical depth profiles and current archaeological interpretation. As for the second validation site, the models highlighted several archaeological hotspots that to some extend spatially coincide with areas of high archaeological potential as indicated by established predictive modelling. Reversely, the classifiers attributed high archaeological potential status to the most southern region of Zeeland, thereby complementing established modelling results. For the third validation site none of the instances were correctly classified and these results clearly show the limitations of geochemical predictive modelling of significantly different soil types (fine-to-coarse sands) compared to the training set (clayey sands). Present proof-of-concept study shows that modelling of multiple-source geochemical soil data using machine-learning algorithms can be successfully accomplished and that model predictions nicely complement current interpretation and/or established archeological predictive modelling of areas of archaeological interest. Limitations of our approach were found to reside in lithological differences between sites used for model training and prediction sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Within the tourism network, our idea tends to include particularly significant and representative sites of Campania's history and culture, little known ones such as Campi Flegrei, Sorrento and Amalfi Coasts, Liternum, Nola, Cimitile, Amalfi, Agerola, Gragnano, etc. The present case study concerns, in particular, the Valle dei Mulini (\""Mills valley\"") in Gragnano, which is an example of proto-industrial archaeology dating back to the twelfth century as well as an old dirt road connecting with Amalfi republic. This site is featured by canals carved into the rocks, which lead water directly to the mills towers, capable of converting the pressure of the hydraulic machine movement into useful energy. More in detail, the sustainable aspect of this project foresees the production of electricity by exploiting the mechanism of the falling water in water towers, giving rise to the grindstone rotational motion which is turned into electrical energy. The water flow passes from one tower to another one, placed at a lower altitude, and then moves on to the next one. Therefore this strategy would enhance the whole ecosystem, by means of site remediation and artifacts restoration, in order to place this resort in the tourism / hospitality circuit and trigger a sustainable process aimed at its future safeguarding.

Datasheets and pictures, stratigraphic data and 3D models, time and space mixed together: these are only a few of the categories a researcher has to deal with. New technologies may be able to help in this process and trying to solve research related problems needs innovative solutions. In this paper, we describe the whole process for the design and development of a prototype application that uses an Immersive Virtual Reality system to acces archaeological excavation 3D data through the Gesture Variation Follower (GVF) algorithm. This makes it possible to recognise which gesture is being performed and how it is performed. Archaeologists have participated actively in the design of the interface and the set of gestures used for triggering the different tasks. Interactive machine learning techniques have been used for the real time detection of the gestures. As a case study the agora of Segesta (Sicily, Italy) has been selected. Indeed, due to the complex architectural features and the still ongoing fieldwork activities, Segesta represents an ideal context where to test and develop a research approach integrating both traditional and more innovative tools and methods.;Albertini et al. - 2017 - DESIGNING NATURAL GESTURE INTERACTION FOR ARCHAEOL.txt

Paradoxically, however, spatial representation lacks the ability to convey archaeological interpretations. By example of excavations in Alken Enge, Denmark, this paper explores how a web-based 3D platform is able to facilitate the collaborative exchange of 3D excavation content and how the integration of spatial and attribute data into one common event-based data model may be advantageous. This includes enhancing the semantic value of field-recorded 3D models by segmenting the geometry using various techniques, such as 3D projections and machine learning. Accordingly, the paper demonstrates a framework for interactive 3D models, which includes attributed classification based on segmented 3D content correlated with traditional raster, vector, and textual data, delivering a spatially integrated platform for collaborative research.;Jensen - 2018 - Semantically Enhanced 3D A Web-based Platform for.txt

The goal is to find the global position and rotation for each fragment so that all fragments jointly \reconstruct\"" the original surface (i.e., solve the puzzle). Manual fragment placement is difficult and time-consuming, especially when fragments are irregularly shaped and uncolored. Systems have been proposed to first acquire 3D surface scans of the fragments and then use computer algorithms to solve the reconstruction problem. These systems work well for small test cases and for puzzles with distinctive features, but fail for larger reconstructions of real wall paintings with eroded and missing fragments due to the complexity of the reconstruction search space. We address the search problem with an unsupervised genetic algorithm: we evolve a pool of partial reconstructions that grow through recombination and selection over the course of generations. We introduce a novel algorithm for combining partial reconstructions that is robust to noise and outliers, and we provide a new selection procedure that balances fitness and diversity in the population. In experiments with a benchmark dataset, our algorithm is able to achieve larger and more accurate global reconstructions than previous automatic algorithms.""";Sizikova et Funkhouser - 2018 - Wall Painting Reconstruction Using a Genetic Algor.txt

NMD2WZGT;journalArticle;2018;"Guyot, Alexandre; Hubert-Moy, Laurence; Lorho, Thierry";Detecting Neolithic Burial Mounds from LiDAR-Derived Elevation Data Using a Multi-Scale Approach and Machine Learning Techniques;Remote Sensing;Airborne LiDAR technology is widely used in archaeology and over the past decade has emerged as an accurate tool to describe anthropomorphic landforms. Archaeological features are traditionally emphasised on a LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using multiple Visualisation Techniques (VTs), and occasionally aided by automated feature detection or classification techniques. Such an approach offers limited results when applied to heterogeneous structures (different sizes, morphologies), which is often the case for archaeological remains that have been altered throughout the ages. This study proposes to overcome these limitations by developing a multi-scale analysis of topographic position combined with supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). Rather than highlighting individual topographic anomalies, the multi-scalar approach allows archaeological features to be examined not only as individual objects, but within their broader spatial context. This innovative and straightforward method provides two levels of results: a composite image of topographic surface structure and a probability map of the presence of archaeological structures. The method was developed to detect and characterise megalithic funeral structures in the region of Carnac, the Bay of Quiberon, and the Gulf of Morbihan (France), which is currently considered for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List. As a result, known archaeological sites have successfully been geo-referenced with a greater accuracy than before (even when located under dense vegetation) and a ground-check confirmed the identification of a previously unknown Neolithic burial mound in the commune of Carnac.;Guyot et al. - 2018 - Detecting Neolithic Burial Mounds from LiDAR-Deriv.txt
JEYVP59G;journalArticle;2018;"Klassen, Sarah; Weed, Jonathan; Evans, Damian";Semi-supervised machine learning approaches for predicting the chronology of archaeological sites: A case study of temples from medieval Angkor, Cambodia;Plos One;"Archaeologists often need to date and group artifact types to discern typologies, chronologies, and classifications. For over a century, statisticians have been using classification and clustering techniques to infer patterns in data that can be defined by algorithms. In the case of archaeology, linear regression algorithms are often used to chronologically date features and sites, and pattern recognition is used to develop typologies and classifications. However, archaeological data is often expensive to collect, and analyses are often limited by poor sample sizes and datasets. Here we show that recent advances in computation allow archaeologists to use machine learning based on much of the same statistical theory to address more complex problems using increased computing power and larger and incomplete datasets. This paper approaches the problem of predicting the chronology of archaeological sites through a case study of medieval temples in Angkor, Cambodia. For this study, we have a large dataset of temples with known architectural elements and artifacts; however, less than ten percent of the sample of temples have known dates, and much of the attribute data is incomplete. Our results suggest that the algorithms can predict dates for temples from 821-1150 CE with a 49-66-year average absolute error. We find that this method surpasses traditional supervised and unsupervised statistical approaches for under-specified portions of the dataset and is a promising new method for anthropological inquiry.";Klassen et al. - 2018 - Semi-supervised machine learning approaches for pr.txt

Over the past 10-15 years, OBIA methods have been introduced to detect archaeological features. Improvements in accuracy have been attained by using a greater number of morphometric variables and multiple scales of analysis. This article highlights the developments that have occurred in the application of OBIA within archaeology and argues that OBIA is both a useful and necessary tool for archaeological research. Additionally, I discuss future research paths using this method. Some of the suggestions put forth here include: pushing for multifaceted research designs utilizing OBIA and manual interpretation, using OBIA methods for directly studying landscape settlement patterns, and increasing data sharing of methods between researchers.;arp.1730.txt
GKVITELT;journalArticle;2019;"Stott, David; Kristiansen, Soren Munch; Sindbaek, Soren Michael";Searching for Viking Age Fortresses with Automatic Landscape Classification and Feature Detection;Remote Sensing;Across the world, cultural heritage is eradicated at an unprecedented rate by development, agriculture, and natural erosion. Remote sensing using airborne and satellite sensors is an essential tool for rapidly investigating human traces over large surfaces of our planet, but even large monumental structures may be visible as only faint indications on the surface. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of a machine learning approach using airborne laser scanning data to address a needle-in-a-haystack problem, which involves the search for remnants of Viking ring fortresses throughout Denmark. First ring detection was applied using the Hough circle transformations and template matching, which detected 202,048 circular features in Denmark. This was reduced to 199 candidate sites by using their geometric properties and the application of machine learning techniques to classify the cultural and topographic context of the features. Two of these near perfectly circular features are convincing candidates for Viking Age fortresses, and two are candidates for either glacial landscape features or simple meteor craters. Ground-truthing revealed the latter sites as ice age features, while the cultural heritage sites BorgO and Tr ae lbanke urge renewed archaeological investigation in the light of our findings. The fact that machine learning identifies compelling new candidate sites for ring fortresses demonstrates the power of the approach. Our automatic approach is applicable worldwide where digital terrain models are available to search for cultural heritage sites, geomorphological features, and meteor impact craters.;Stott et al. - 2019 - Searching for Viking Age Fortresses with Automatic.txt
ZYLSA4NP;journalArticle;2019;"Pargeter, Justin; Khreisheh, Nada; Stout, Dietrich";Understanding stone tool-making skill acquisition: Experimental methods and evolutionary implications;Journal of Human Evolution;Despite its theoretical importance, the process of stone tool-making skill acquisition remains understudied and poorly understood. The challenges and costs of skill learning constitute an oft-neglected factor in the evaluation of alternative adaptive strategies and a potential source of bias in cultural transmission. Similarly, theory and data indicate that the most salient neural and cognitive demands of stone tool-making should occur during learning rather than expert performance. Unfortunately, the behavioral complexity and extensive learning requirements that make stone knapping skill acquisition an interesting object of study are the very features that make it so challenging to investigate experimentally. Here we present results from a multidisciplinary study of Late Acheulean handaxe-making skill acquisition involving twenty-six naive participants and up to 90 hours training over several months, accompanied by a battery of psychometric, behavioral, and neuroimaging assessments. In this initial report, we derive a robust quantitative skill metric for the experimental handaxes using machine learning algorithms, reconstruct a group-level learning curve, and explore sources of individual variation in learning outcomes. Results identify particular cognitive targets of selection on the efficiency or reliability of tool-making skill acquisition, quantify learning costs, highlight the likely importance of social support, motivation, persistence, and self-control in knapping skill acquisition, and illustrate methods for reliably reconstructing ancient learning processes from archaeological evidence.

GM5WBJ3T;journalArticle;2019;"Benner, Jordan; Knudby, Anders; Nielsen, Julie; Krawchuk, Meg; Lertzman, Ken";Combining data from field surveys and archaeological records to predict the distribution of culturally important trees;Diversity and Distributions;Aim Indigenous communities involved in conservation planning require spatial datasets depicting the distribution of culturally important species. However, accessing datasets on the location of these species can be challenging, particularly when the current distribution no longer reflects areas with the full range of suitable growing conditions because of past logging. We test whether using occurrence data from community-based field surveys and archaeological records in species distribution models can help predict the distribution of monumental western redcedar trees (Thuja plicata)-large, high-quality trees suitable for cultural purposes such as carving dug-out canoes, totem poles and traditional houses. This species is critically important to indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest of North America, but trees suitable for traditional carving and building are diminishing in abundance due to logging. Location Our analysis covers the spatial extent of the traditional territory of the Heiltsuk First Nation, which encompasses a portion of the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, Canada. Methods We built and compared species distribution models using the machine learning program, Maxent, based on occurrence data from field surveys and archaeological records of culturally modified trees. Results Our findings highlight similarities and differences between the predictions from these species distribution models. When validating these models against occurrences from an independent dataset, the archaeological record model performs better than the field survey model. These findings may arise because the independent dataset was collected on an unlogged island-an environment that aligns more closely with the historic forest conditions revealed by the archaeological records than the current distribution revealed by the field surveys. Main conclusions We demonstrate and discuss the utility of using archaeological data in species distribution modelling and conservation planning when the target species is associated with shifting environmental baselines, data limitations and an important cultural resource.;ddi.12947.txt
4T8WIFKG;journalArticle;2019;"Altaweel, Mark; Squitieri, Andrea";Finding a Relatively Flat Archaeological Site with Minimal Ceramics: A Case Study from Iraqi Kurdistan;Journal of Field Archaeology;We present a new technique to detect flat archaeological sites with minimal ceramics using an unmanned aerial vehicle that maps surface stone concentrations. Methods deployed include point pattern analysis of stone concentrations and a machine-learning technique using unsupervised classification of visible stone signature qualities, which are used in simple linear regressions to compare with geophysical and ceramic surface survey results of a site in Iraqi Kurdistan. There is a stronger fit (r(2 )= 0.77) between surface stone concentrations and architecture identified by geophysical measurement, while surveyed ceramics show a weaker fit to defined architecture (r(2 )= 0.31). Surface stone concentrations are potentially a better proxy than ceramics for determining the presence of past settlement in regions where stone was commonly used, sites are relatively flat, and ceramics are found in low concentrations. The methods advanced here can be scaled to wider areas, particularly in mountainous regions, where surface stone features are present.;00934690.2019.1662269.txt
H8HK8ZE7;journalArticle;2019;"Ponciano, Jean-Jacques; Trerneau, Alain; Boochs, Frank";Automatic Detection of Objects in 3D Point Clouds Based on Exclusively Semantic Guided Processes;Isprs International Journal of Geo-Information;In the domain of computer vision, object recognition aims at detecting and classifying objects in data sets. Model-driven approaches are typically constrained through their focus on either a specific type of data, a context (indoor, outdoor) or a set of objects. Machine learning-based approaches are more flexible but also constrained as they need annotated data sets to train the learning process. That leads to problems when this data is not available through the specialty of the application field, like archaeology, for example. In order to overcome such constraints, we present a fully semantic-guided approach. The role of semantics is to express all relevant knowledge of the representation of the objects inside the data sets and of the algorithms which address this representation. In addition, the approach contains a learning stage since it adapts the processing according to the diversity of the objects and data characteristics. The semantic is expressed via an ontological model and uses standard web technology like SPARQL queries, providing great flexibility. The ontological model describes the object, the data and the algorithms. It allows the selection and execution of algorithms adapted to the data and objects dynamically. Similarly, processing results are dynamically classified and allow for enriching the ontological model using SPARQL construct queries. The semantic formulated through SPARQL also acts as a bridge between the knowledge contained within the ontological model and the processing branch, which executes algorithms. It provides the capability to adapt the sequence of algorithms to an individual state of the processing chain and makes the solution robust and flexible. The comparison of this approach with others on the same use case shows the efficiency and improvement this approach brings.;Ponciano et al. - 2019 - Automatic Detection of Objects in 3D Point Clouds .txt

E.";Drivers of Late Pleistocene human survival and dispersal: an agent-based modeling and machine learning approach;Quaternary Science Reviews;Understanding Late Pleistocene human dispersals from Africa requires understanding a multifaceted problem with factors varying in space and time, such as climate, ecology, human behavior, and population dynamics. To understand how these factors interact to affect human survival and dispersal, we have developed a realistic agent-based model that includes geographic features, climate change, and time-varying vegetation and food resources. To enhance computational efficiency, we further apply machine learning algorithms. Our approach is new in that it is designed to systematically evaluate a large-scale agent-based model, and identify its key parameters and sensitivities. Results show that parameter interactions are the major source in generating variability in human dispersal and survival/extinction scenarios. In realistic scenarios with geographical features and time-evolving climatic conditions, random fluctuations become a major source of variability in arrival times and success. Furthermore, parameter settings as different as 92% of maximum possible difference, and occupying more than 30% of parameter space can result in similar dispersal scenarios. This suggests that historical contingency (similar causes - different effects) and equifinality (different causes - similar effects) are primary constituents of human dispersal scenarios. While paleoanthropology, archaeology and paleogenetics now provide insights into patterns of human dispersals at an unprecedented level of detail, elucidating the causes underlying these patterns remains a major challenge.

A.; Garcia-Molsosa, A.";A brave new world for archaeological survey: Automated machine learning-based potsherd detection using high-resolution drone imagery;Journal of Archaeological Science;Archaeological pedestrian survey is one of the most popular techniques available for primary detection of archaeological sites and description of past landscape use. As such it is an essential tool not just for the understanding of past human distribution, economy, demography and so on but also for cultural heritage management and protection. The most common type of pedestrian surface survey consists of fieldwalking relatively large tracts of land, recording the dispersion of items of material culture, predominantly pottery fragments, by teams of archaeologists and students. This paper presents the first proof of concept for the automated recording of material culture dispersion across large areas using high resolution drone imagery, photogrammetry and a combination of machine learning and geospatial analysis that can be run using the Google Earth Engine geospatial cloud computing platform. The results show the potential of this technique, under appropriate field circumstances, to produce accurate distribution maps of individual potsherds opening a new horizon for the application of archaeological survey. The paper also discusses current limitations and future developments of this method.;Orengo et Garcia-Molsosa - 2019 - A brave new world for archaeological survey Autom.txt

Their distribution and dispersal patterns are key to our understanding of the habitation patterns of our ancestors. Due to the nature of these structures and the construction materials used, centuries of abandonment means that they often go unnoticed at ground level, while being easily identified from an aerial perspective. The increased requirements of land use for the development of urban areas, infrastructure and increased industrialised farming practices means that these monuments are under threat. Recent developments in the field of machine learning coupled with access to hi-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery from Open Data sources, presents the opportunity to investigate the development of a system for the automated detection of these features. If successful, such a system could provide an automated, efficient and cost effective tool for the detection of interference or destruction of known sites as well as the discovery of new ones.;Phelan_Riordan_2020.txt

The selection of formal attributes to allow effective measurement and comparison of complex shapes, though, presents a crucial challenge to systematic study. Alongside fabric composition and surface treatment, consistent linear dimensions offer helpful metrics for assessing standardized production. More difficult to measure, though, are the many finely graduated variations in shape that can reflect how these processes were implemented and the limits to large-scale serial productions like those of the ancient Mediterranean world. We offer here a new method and computational pipeline, developed using open-source libraries, to quantify morphological similarities and differences among ceramics. Grounded in point cloud comparison, our method enables comprehensive 3D characterization of geometries down to the pixel level and leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and high-speed data structures for efficiency and scalability across large assemblages. Case studies of transport amphoras from two late antique shipwrecks off the coast of southwest Turkey demonstrate the robustness of the methodology and pipeline. Together, they provide an analytically rigorous and flexible approach to quantifying formal variation within a dataset. The first results suggest strategies for controlling the capacities of these transport jars within late ancient systems of production, but the method should also prove useful in formal analysis of artifacts of other forms and contexts.;Vo-Phamhi_2020.txt
SZC9LX36;journalArticle;2020;Ramazzotti, Marco;Modeling the past. Logics, semantics and neural computing in archaeology;Archeologia E Calcolatori;The study of complex archaeological systems through the new Artificial Intelligence and Natural and Neural Computing is a research project which evaluates the historical meaning of the relationships between records of the past as an essentially human construction. It repeats a strong position of Analytical Archaeology, but updates it on the basis of the progress which neurosciences and physics have made in simulating the principles which regulate memory, orientation, classification and mapping of reality. Modelling and simulating the contexts of the past in integrated, parallel, distributed processing through machine learning methods, must make use of a precise encoding of the documents. It takes on an important role in empirical research only when the results produced become the hyper-surface of a network membrane to continue, update, refine or open the analysis itself. After some 30 years of such theoretical, analytical and experimental research, logics, semantics and applications of neural computing maintain their distinct value as a new theoretical approach for the study of dynamic and systemic cultural complexity. They provide a new analytical paradigm for computational modelling in archaeology and an advanced computational method for pattern recognition in archaeometry.;RAMAZZOTTI_2020.txt

For this purpose, methods of object mining in 3D data are to be developed.

Based on 200 of those terracottas, a classification system will be elaborated with digital methods, which is able to meet the complexity of the artefacts. In close cooperation between computer science and archaeology, this experimental process leads to a fundamental examination of the concept of pattern recognition as a humanities category.

Glen Canyon NRA consists of approximately 5,000 km 2 in Arizona and Utah containing evidence of multiple prehistoric cultures spanning at least 10000 years. Large portions of Glen Canyon NRA have never been inventoried for archaeological resources. Archaeological sites are potentially subject to irreparable damage along roads and receding Lake Powell shorelines accessible to off-road vehicles and boats. The diverse cultural history, highly variable physiographic environments, archaeological site data inconsistencies, and limited available model variable data provided challenges. Model results improved by classifying sites, based on their inferred usage, and distinguishing distinct physiographic regions within the larger NRA landscape.

To guide this search task, NER is needed. We created rigorous annotation guidelines in an iterative process, then instructed five archaeology students to annotate a number of documents. The resulting dataset contains similar to 31k annotations between six entity types (artefact, time period, place, context, species & material). The inter-annotator agreement is 0.95, and when we used this data for machine learning, we observed an increase in F1 score from 0.51 to 0.70 in comparison to a machine learning model trained on a dataset created in prior work. This indicates that the data is of high quality, and can confidently be used to train NER classifiers.;Brandsen_2020.txt

With impending climate-related risks such as increased coastal erosion and rising sea levels, coupled with rapid urban development, gaps in our knowledge of the human history of this continent are in jeopardy of becoming permanent. Spaceborne and aerial remote sensing instruments are powerful tools for producing relatively complete records of archaeological settlement patterns and human behavior at landscape scales. These sensors allow for massive amounts of information to be recorded and analyzed in short spans of time and offer an effective means to increase survey areas and the discovery of new cultural deposits. In this paper, we review various case studies throughout Africa dealing with aerial and satellite remote sensing applications to landscape archaeology in order to highlight recent developments and future research avenues. Specifically, we argue that (semi)automated remote sensing methods stemming from machine learning developments will prove vital to expanding our knowledge base of Africa's archaeological record. This is especially important for coastal and island regions of the continent where climate change threatens the survival of much of the archaeological record.;s10437-020-09373-y.txt

However, the un-monitored deployment of UAVs called the amateur drones (AmDr) can lead to serious security threats and risk to human life and infrastructure. Therefore, timely detection of the AmDr is essential for the protection and security of sensitive organizations, human life and other vital infrastructure. AmDrs can be detected using different techniques based on sound, video, thermal, and radio frequencies. However, the performance of these techniques is limited in sever atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we propose an efficient un-supervise machine learning approach of independent component analysis (ICA) to detect various acoustic signals i.e., sounds of bird, airplanes, thunderstorm, rain, wind and the UAVs in practical scenario. After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), the power spectral density (PSD) and the Root Mean Square Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM)and K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)to detect the presence or absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a single or multiple AmDrs at a time in the presence of multiple acoustic interfering signals. The proposed technique is verified through extensive simulations and it is observed that the RMS values of PSD with KNN performs better than the MFCC with KNN and SVM.;Uddin et al. - 2020 - Amateur Drones Detection A machine learning appro.txt

Several different machine learning algorithms for binary pixel classification (i.e. stone vs non-stone) were evaluated. Input features were extracted from high-resolution orthomosaics and digital elevation models (both derived from aerial imaging). Comparative analysis used two colour spaces (RGB and HSV), texture features (contrast, homogeneity and entropy raster maps), and the topographic position index, combined with nine supervised learning algorithms (nearest centroid, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, linear and quadratic discriminant analyses, support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural network). When features are processed together, excellent output maps, very close to or outperforming current standards in archaeology, are observed for almost all classifiers. The size of the training set can be drastically reduced (to ca. 300 samples) by majority voting, while maintaining performance at the highest level (about 99.5% for all performance scores). Note, however, that if the training set is inadequate or not fully representative, the classification results are poor. That said, the methods applied and tested here are extremely rapid. Extensive mapping, which would have been difficult with traditional, manual, or semiautomatic delineation of stones using a vector graphics editor, now becomes possible.

The Cholistan Desert presents one of the largest concentrations of Indus Civilization sites (from ca. 3300 to 1500 BC). Cholistan has figured prominently in theories about changes in water availability, the rise and decline of the Indus Civilization, and the transformation of fertile monsoonal alluvial plains into an extremely arid margin. This paper implements a multisensor, multitemporal machine-learning approach for the remote detection of archaeological mounds. A classifier algorithm that employs a large-scale collection of synthetic-aperture radar and multispectral images has been implemented in Google Earth Engine, resulting in an accurate probability map for mound-like signatures across an area that covers ca. 36,000 km(2). The results show that the area presents many more archaeological mounds than previously recorded, extending south and east into the desert, which has major implications for understanding the archaeological significance of the region. The detection of small (<5 ha) to large mounds (>30 ha) suggests that there were continuous shifts in settlement location. These shifts are likely to reflect responses to a dynamic and changing hydrological network and the influence of the progressive northward advance of the desert in a long-term process that culminated in the abandonment of much of the settled area during the Late Harappan period.;Orengo et al. - 2020 - Automated detection of archaeological mounds using.txt

While bedrock geology is stable over thousands of years, geomorphological processes can influence the Sr-87/Sr-86 in ecosystems over archeologically relevant timescales. Among these geomorphological processes, the deposition and reworking of volcanic sediments over Quaternary timescales are little studied but could be an important control of Sr-87/Sr-86 variations in many archeological regions. North Patagonia is a key archeological region to address animal and human movements, and an ideal location to test the influence of Quaternary volcanism on Sr-87/Sr-86 variation as it is located downwind of major volcanic centers. In this study, we aim to assess the main environmental and geological controls of bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 and to build a high-resolution isoscape using a machine learning regression framework for forthcoming paleomobility studies. We sampled several locations and analyzed different types of samples (N = 94). The ratios show a limited range of variation, which is not related to the bedrock geology. Rather, bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 variations display a progressive increase going eastward (away from the Andes), following dust aerosol deposition and elevation variations (R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 0.00041). We argue that this trend relates to the deposition and reworking of unradiogenic volcanic sediments by aeolian, fluvial and glacial erosion during the Quaternary. As most of this sediment reworking occurred during glacial periods, the current bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 variations across the study area likely represent a long-term average that varied little during the Holocene. Consequently, our isoscape provides a solid base for Holocene paleomobility studies in North Patagonia and underlines the importance of Quaternary volcanism processes for interpreting Sr-87/Sr-86 data in paleomobility studies in volcanic regions.;Serna et al. - 2020 - Implications for paleomobility studies of the effe.txt
GFSLM36K;journalArticle;2020;"Stewart, Christopher; Labreche, Georges; Gonzalez, Daniel Lombrana";A Pilot Study on Remote Sensing and Citizen Science for Archaeological Prospection;Remote Sensing;Cost-effective techniques for systematic archaeological prospection are essential to improve the efficiency of preventive archaeology and the preservation of cultural heritage. Web Mapping Services, such as Microsoft Bing Maps, provide imagery covering extensive areas at high resolution. These can, in some cases, reveal cropmarks of buried historical structures. Given that archaeological prospection is not generally the priority of most common Web Mapping Services, the conditions under which images are acquired are not always suitable for the appearance of cropmarks. Therefore, their detection is typically serendipitous. This pilot project attempts to assess the potential to use the Microsoft Bing Maps Bird's Eye service within a crowdsourcing platform to systematically search for archaeological cropmarks in the surroundings of the city of Rome in Italy. On this platform, which is hosted by the company Scifabric (Southampton, UK) and based on PyBossa, an Open Source framework for crowdsourcing, members of the public are invited to interpret oblique air photo tiles of Bing Maps Bird's Eye. While the project is still on-going, at least one seamless coverage of tiles in the area of interest has been interpreted. For each tile, the Bing Maps Bird's Eye service provides oblique air photo coverage in up to four possible orientations. As of 5 July 2020, 18,765 of the total 67,014 tasks have been completed. Amongst these completed tasks, positive detections of cropmarks were recorded once for 1447 tasks, twice for 57 tasks, and three or more times for 10 tasks. While many of these detections may be erroneous, some correspond with archaeological cropmarks of buried remains of buildings, roads, aqueducts, and urban areas from the Roman period, as verified by comparison with archaeological survey data. This leads to the conclusion that the Bing Maps Bird's Eye service contains a wealth of information useful for archaeological prospection, and that to a certain extent citizen researchers could help to mine this information. However, a more thorough analysis would need to be carried out on possible false negatives and biases related to the varying ease of interpretation of residues of different archaeological structures from multiple historical periods. This activity forms the first part of a research project on the systematic prospection of archaeological cropmarks. The ultimate aim is to reach a critical mass of training data through crowdsourcing which can be augmented and used as input to train a machine learning algorithm for automatic detection on a larger scale.;Stewart et al. - 2020 - A Pilot Study on Remote Sensing and Citizen Scienc.txt

Yet, archaeological applications of predictive models are often insufficient due to small training data sets, inadequate statistical techniques, and a lack of theoretical insight to explain the responses of past land use to predictor variables. Here we address these critiques and evaluate the predictive power of four statistical approaches widely used in ecological modeling-generalized linear models, generalized additive models, maximum entropy, and random forests-to predict the locations of Formative Period (2100-650 BP) archaeological sites in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. We assess each modeling approach using a threshold-independent measure, the area under the curve (AUC), and threshold-dependent measures, like the true skill statistic. We find that the majority of the modeling approaches struggle with archaeological datasets due to the frequent lack of true-absence locations, which violates model assumptions of generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and random forests, as well as measures of their predictive power (AUC). Maximum entropy is the only method tested here which is capable of utilizing pseudo-absence points (inferred absence data based on known presence data) and controlling for a non-representative sampling of the landscape, thus making maximum entropy the best modeling approach for common archaeological data when the goal is prediction. Regression-based approaches may be more applicable when prediction is not the goal, given their grounding in well-established statistical theory. Random forests, while the most powerful, is not applicable to archaeological data except in the rare case where true-absence data exist. Our results have significant implications for the application of predictive models by archaeologists for research and conservation purposes and highlight the importance of understanding model assumptions.;Yaworsky et al. - 2020 - Advancing predictive modeling in archaeology An e.txt

The data set contains ancient Maya structures that were manually labeled, and ground verified to a large extent. We have built and compared two deep learning-based models, U-Net and Mask R-CNN, for semantic segmentation. The segmentation models were used in two tasks: identification of areas of ancient construction activity, and identification of the remnants of ancient Maya buildings. The U-Net based model performed better in both tasks and was capable of correctly identifying 60-66% of all objects, and 74-81% of medium sized objects. The quality of the resulting prediction was evaluated using a variety of quantifiers. Furthermore, we discuss the problems of re-purposing the archaeological style labeling for production of valid machine learning training sets. Ultimately, we outline the value of these models for archaeological research and present the road map to produce a useful decision support system for recognition of ancient objects in LiDAR data.;rs12223685.txt

This region hosts critical developments in hominin and human evolution, the dispersal of food-producing populations across the continent, and some of the largest known contemporary mammalian migrations on the planet. Strontium isotope analysis of biominerals such as tooth enamel, eggshell, and other tissues in modern animals have been used to reconstruct migration, residential mobility, and provenience. The diverse geologies of Kenya and Tanzania, ranging from the Archaean Basement System rocks of the Tanzania Craton to the recent volcanics of rift valleys, make it a highly promising area for mobility and provenience studies using strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86). Nevertheless, the application of strontium isotope analysis to reconstruct migration and individual mobility has been limited in the region due to the lack of a map predicting biologically available (bioavailable) Sr-87/Sr-86. We present bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 data from a variety of modern and archaeological materials throughout Kenya and northern Tanzania. We show that Sr-87/Sr-86 of living organisms in the study area range from as low as 0.70439 for samples collected from Neogene volcanics to 0.72796 for samples collected from Precambrian Basement System rocks. We also present an Sr-87/Sr-86 map (isoscape) of Kenya and Tanzania developed using a machine-learning framework and a compilation of bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 data from Africa. This map provides the first predictions of bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 for East Africa, and represents a crucial resource for future work on ancient and modern animal and human mobility.;janzen2020.txt

In this work, we are interested in the analysis and classification of ceramic sherds tomographic images in order to help archaeologists in learning about the fabrication processes of ancient pottery. More specifically, a particular manufacturing process (spiral patchwork) has recently been discovered in early Neolithic Mediterranean sites, along with a more traditional coiling technique. It has been shown that the ceramic pore distribution in available tomographic images of both archaeological and experimental samples can reveal which manufacturing technique was used. Indeed, with the spiral patchwork, the pores exhibit spiral-like behaviours, whereas with the traditional one, they are distributed along parallel lines, especially in the experimental samples. However, in archaeological samples, these distributions are very noisy, making analysis and discrimination hard to process. Here, we investigate how Learning Methods (Deep Learning and Support Vector Machine) can be used to answer these numerically difficult problems. In particular, we study how the results depend on the input data (either raw data at the output of the tomographic device, or after a preliminary pore segmentation step), and the quality of the information they could provide to archaeologists.;Dia et al. - 2021 - Applications of Learning Methods to Imaging Issues.txt

The first step that is undertaken in this process is the chemical analysis of the object, in order to decide the best procedures for its restoration. The gold standard in approximating the concentration of the elements in its composition (in percentages, between 0 and 100) is performed through an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) machine. While this is a non-invasive approach, it comes at substantial financial and training costs, and possible radiation exposure of the investigator. In this context, the present paper explores the potential of a deep learning regression model to give an estimate on the concentration of a given element from stereo microscopy slides of historical artefacts, as an alternative means to the XRF. Two problems with different degrees of complexity are examined in turn. The first one is represented by the consideration of iron objects, where the metal is strongly dominant in the chemical structure. The second comes both as a complement to the other, in order to expose the model also to non-iron items, and as a more difficult task of identifying the degree of copper that is present only as part of an alloy constitution. While for iron the one absolute value prediction of the model is always very close to the XRF approximation, copper has a wider distribution of its concentration among objects, which is more challenging to learn; hence, performance for a singular absolute estimation can rise only with the increase in the amount of data. A window of error acceptability was also implemented and it allows for an approximation that is sufficient for grasping the degree of the metal in the composition that is necessary for the restoration procedures. The findings therefore provide a first step in putting forward a computational support tool that represents a less expensive and less dangerous alternative for approximating the elemental analysis before artefact reinstatement.

Nevertheless, it has never been used for the stratigraphic study of historical buildings. Thus far, archaeologists and architects, the experts in archaeology of architecture, have led this research. The method consisted of visually-and, consequently, subjectively-identifying certain evidence regarding the elevations of such buildings that could be a consequence of the passage of time. In this article, we would like to present the results from one of the research projects pursued by our group, in which we automated the stratigraphic study of some historic buildings using multivariate statistic techniques. To this end, we first measured the building using surveying techniques to create a 3D model, and then, we broke down every stone into qualitative and quantitative variables. To identify the stratigraphic features on the walls, we applied machine learning by conducting different predictive and descriptive analyses. The predictive analyses were used to rule out any blocks of stone with different characteristics, such as rough stones, joint ashlars, and voussoirs of arches; these are irregularities that probably show building processes and whose identification is crucial in ascertaining the structural evolution of the building. In supervised learning, we experimented with decision trees and random forest- and although the results were good in all cases, we ultimately opted to implement the predictive model obtained using the last one. While identifying the evidence on the walls, it was also very important to identify different continuity solutions or interfaces present on them, because although these are elements without materiality, they are of great value in terms of timescale, because they delimit different strata and allow us to deduce the relationship between them.";Mesanza-Moraza et al. - 2021 - Machine Learning for the Built Heritage Archaeolog.txt

Previous works have pointed out the relationship between flake attributes and prediction of flake mass. This study builds on previous works by using data from an experimental collection of flakes. Estimated mass was arrived at by generating a multiple linear regression model that combines several predictive variables. Variable selection for model training was carried out by using best subset selection, which evaluates all possible combinations of variables. Evaluation of the model was performed by computing common machine learning statistics along with estimated percentage error. Results make it possible to determine the best variables and estimate their relationships with flake mass. On the other hand, results also show that although the model is slightly biased and performs adequately, it has a limited inferential ability, especially when compared with other methods/indexes employed to estimate reduction.;BUSTOS-PEREZ_2021.txt

The pigments used in prehistoric paintings present high light sensitivity and rigorous scientific color degradation mapping is not usually undertaken in overall archaeological sites. Microfading spectrometry is a suitable technique for determining the light-stability of pigments found in rock art paintings in a non-destructive way. Spectral data can be transformed into colorimetric information following the recommendations published by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage(CIE). The fading degree can be evaluated through the color changes produced, computing both color and chromatic differences. Microfading Tester (MFT) measurements on spot samples are time-consuming and difficult to materialize on-site. This paper presents the results of statistical Gaussian process interpolation to map the potential MFT spectral variations overtime on a scene full of prehistoric rock art paintings. In addition, a descriptive analysis of color variations that may suffer the rock art motifs overtime has been carried out. The advanced statistical methodology implemented can highlight potential changes on some rock support areas, and stable conditions on the painted red motifs over time, which can help to establish future conservation actions in the archaeological site.

However, the sheer amount of traces and of available high-quality data necessitates the use of computational methods for the automatic detection of these archaeological objects. Therefore, a novel approach, named CarcassonNet, has been developed that uses a combination of a Deep Learning convolutional neural network and image processing algorithms to detect and trace hollow roads in LiDAR data from the Netherlands. CarcassonNet has been specifically developed for the archaeological domain, focusing on being computationally light and suited for reconstructing partially preserved and intersected hollow roads. Instead of using the whole roads as input for the convolutional neural network, in CarcassonNet individual sections are used. This makes it much more cost-effective to create a sufficient training dataset, and makes the classification task (performed by the neural network) relatively simple, with better detection results. The output of CarcassonNet consists of two types of geospatial vectors that offer the opportunity to efficiently study the roads themselves and their precise location in the landscape (polygons), and the course of the roads and the resulting route network (lines). An experimental evaluation shows that CarcassonNet is able to effectively detect hollow roads, with a MCC score of 0.47. Furthermore, it is shown that using the Digital Terrain Model, instead of visualized LiDAR data (hillshade) improves the performance of the convolutional neural network. The results of this research offer opportunities to reconstruct vanished and abandoned (post)medieval routes and answer questions about human-landscape interactions. (C) 2020 L'Auteur(s).

In this work we employ the first ever machine learning analysis of Australian rock art using a data efficient transfer learning approach to identify features suitable for distinguishing styles of rock art. These features are evaluated in a one-shot learning setting. Results demonstrate that known Arnhem Land Rock art styles can be resolved without knowledge of prior groupings. We then analyse the activation space of learned features and report on the relationships between styles and arrange these classes into a stylistic chronology based on distance within the activation space. By generating a stylistic chronology, it is shown that the model is sensitive to both temporal and spatial patterns in the distribution of rock art in the Arnhem Land Plateau region. More broadly, this approach is ideally suited to evaluating style within any material culture assemblage and overcomes the common constraint of small training data sets in archaeological machine learning studies.;Kowlessar et al. - 2021 - Reconstructing rock art chronology with transfer l.txt

The ArchAIDE project realised an AI-based application to recognise archaeological pottery. Pottery is of paramount importance for understanding archaeological contexts. However, recognition of ceramics is still a manual, time-consuming activity, reliant on analogue catalogues. The project developed two complementary machine-learning tools to propose identifications based on images captured on-site, for optimising and economising this process, while retaining key decision points necessary to create trusted results. One method relies on the shape of a potsherd; the other is based on decorative features. For the shape-based recognition, a novel deep-learning architecture was employed, integrating shape information from points along the inner and outer profile of a sherd. The decoration classifier is based on relatively standard architectures used in image recognition. In both cases, training the algorithms meant facing challenges related to real-world archaeological data: the scarcity of labelled data; extreme imbalance between instances of different categories; and the need to take note of minute differentiating features. Finally, the creation of a desktop and mobile application that integrates the AI classifiers provides an easy-to-use interface for pottery classification and storing pottery data.";Gualandi et al. - 2021 - An Open System for Collection and Automatic Recogn.txt
P9DPXPPH;journalArticle;2021;"Navarro, Pablo; Cintas, Celia; Lucena, Manuel; Manuel Fuertes, Jose; Delrieux, Claudio; Molinos, Manuel";Learning feature representation of Iberian ceramics with automatic classification models;Journal of Cultural Heritage;In Cultural Heritage inquiries, a common requirement is to establish time-based trends between archaeological artifacts belonging to different periods of a given culture, enabling among other things to determine chronological inferences with higher accuracy and precision. Among these, pottery vessels are significantly useful, given their relative abundance in most archaeological sites. However, this very abundance makes difficult and complex an accurate representation, since no two of these vessels are identical, and therefore classification criteria must be justified and applied. For this purpose, we propose the use of deep learning architectures to extract automatically learned features without prior knowledge or engineered features. By means of transfer learning, we retrained a Residual Neural Network with a binary image database of Iberian wheel-made pottery vessels' profiles. These vessels pertain to archaeological sites located in the upper valley of the Guadalquivir River (Spain). The resulting model can provide an accurate feature representation space, which can automatically classify profile images, achieving a mean accuracy of 0.96 with an f -measure of 0.96. This accuracy is remarkably higher than other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, where several feature extraction techniques were applied together with multiple classifier models. These results provide novel strategies to current research in automatic feature representation and classification of different objects of study within the Archaeology domain.

This tradition was particularly strong during the Nordic Bronze Age (1700-550 BC) in southern Scandinavia with over 20,000 boats and thousands of humans, animals, wagons, etc. This vivid and highly engaging material provides quantitative data of high potential to understand Bronze Age social structures and ideologies. The ability to provide the technically best possible documentation and to automate identification and classification of images would help to take full advantage of the research potential of petroglyphs in southern Scandinavia and elsewhere. We, therefore, attempted to train a model that locates and classifies image objects using faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster-RCNN) based on data produced by a novel method to improve visualizing the content of 3D documentations. A newly created layer of 3D rock art documentation provides the best data currently available and has reduced inscribed bias compared to older methods. Several models were trained based on input images annotated with bounding boxes produced with different parameters to find the best solution. The data included 4305 individual images in 408 scans of rock art sites. To enhance the models and enrich the training data, we used data augmentation and transfer learning. The successful models perform exceptionally well on boats and circles, as well as with human figures and wheels. This work was an interdisciplinary undertaking which led to important reflections about archaeology, digital humanities, and artificial intelligence.

Provenancing biological materials using strontium isotope ratios requires a map of bioavailable strontium, commonly known as an isoscape, to compare results with. Both producing the isoscape and using it to interpret results present methodological challenges that researchers must carefully consider. A review of current research indicates that, while many archives can be analyzed to produce isoscapes, modern plant materials usually provide the best approximation of bioavailable strontium and can be used alone or combined with other archives if applying machine learning. Domain mapping currently produces the most accurate, most interpretable isoscapes for most research questions; however, machine learning approaches promise to provide more accurate and geographically wide-ranging isoscapes over time. Using strontium isotope analysis for provenancing is most successful when combined with other isotopes and/or trace elements as part of a likelihood approach. Strontium isoscapes that are both appropriate and sufficiently high resolution to answer specific research questions do not exist for most parts of the world. Researchers intending to incorporate strontium analysis into their research designs should expect to conduct primary sampling and analysis to create appropriate isoscapes or refine existing ones, which should themselves not be uncritically utilized. When sampling, it is essential to collect appropriate metadata; these metadata and the results of the analyses should be archived in one of several online databases to maximize their usefulness. With increasing amounts of primary data and the likely increased availability of machine learning approaches to mapping, strontium analysis will continue to improve as a method of provenancing.";Holt et al. - 2021 - Strontium (Sr-87Sr-86) mapping A critical review.txt

This includes: (i) Image Analysis (IA) to quantify mineral phase proportions, grain size distribution using the Weka trainable machine learning algorithm. (ii) Portable Xray fluorescence spectrometer (PXRF, Bruker Tracer IV) to quantify the whole-rock?s chemical composition. For this purpose, a specific calibration method dedicated to igneous rocks using the open-source CloudCal app was developed. It was then validated for several key elements (Si, Al, K, Ti, Ca, Fe, Mn, Sr, Ga, Ba, Rb, Zn, Nb, Zr, and Y) by analyzing certified standard reference igneous rocks. (iii) Portable Magnetic Susceptibilimeter (pMS, Bartington MS2K system) to constrain the mineralogical contribution of the samples. The operational conditions for these three methods were tested and optimized by analyzing five unprepared surfaces of igneous rocks ranging from a coarse-grained alkaline granite to a fine-grained porphyric diorite and hence, covering variable grain sizes, mineralogical contents, and whole-rock geochemical compositions. For pMS and PXRF tools, one hundred analyses were conducted as a 10 cm ? 10 cm square grid on each sample. Bootstrap analysis was implemented to establish the best grid size sampling to reach an optimized reproducibility of the whole-rock signature. For PXRF analysis, averaged compositions were compared to PXRF analysis on press-pellets and laboratory WD-XRF analysis on fused disk and solution ICP-OES (for major) and solution-ICPMS (for trace element concentrations). Ultimately, this workflow was applied in the field on granitoids from three Roman quarrying sites in the Lavezzi archipelago (southern Corsica) and tested against the Bonifacio granitic War Memorial, for which its provenance is established.

This work is intended to apply a new methodology to the field of underwater archaeology. Shipwrecks represent a major resource to understand maritime human activity over millennia, but underwater archaeology is expensive, misappropriated, and hazardous. An automated tool to rapidly detect and map shipwrecks can therefore be used to create more accurate maps of natural and archaeological features to aid management objectives, study patterns across the landscape, and find new features. Additionally, more comprehensive and accurate shipwreck maps can help to prioritize site selection and plan excavation. The model is based on open source topo-bathymetric data and shipwreck data for the United States available from NOAA. The model uses transfer learning to compensate for a relatively small sample size and addresses a recurring problem that associated work has had with false positives by training the model both on shipwrecks and background topography. Results of statistical analyses conducted-ANOVAs and box and whisker plots-indicate that there are substantial differences between the morphologic characteristics that define shipwrecks vs. background topography, supporting this approach to addressing false positives. The model uses a YOLOv3 architecture and produced an F1 score of 0.92 and a precision score of 0.90, indicating that the approach taken herein to address false positives was successful.;rs13091759.txt

We used this isotopic compilation and remote sensing data to apply a multivariate machine-learning regression, and to predict sulfur isotope variations across Western Europe.

The archaeological record includes physical features associated with human activity; these exist within ecological landscapes and provide a unique long-term perspective on human-environment interactions. The potential for fire-caused damage to archaeological materials is of major concern because these resources are irreplaceable and non-renewable, have social or religious significance for living peoples, and are protected by an extensive body of legislation. Although previous studies have modeled ecological burn severity as a function of environmental setting and climate, the fidelity of these variables as predictors of archaeological fire effects has not been evaluated. This study, focused on prehistoric archaeological sites in a fire-prone and archaeologically rich landscape in the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico, USA, identified the environmental and climate variables that best predict observed fire severity and fire effects to archaeological features and artifacts. Results Machine learning models (Random Forest) indicate that topography and variables related to pre-fire weather and fuel condition are important predictors of fire effects and severity at archaeological sites. Fire effects were more likely to be present when fire-season weather was warmer and drier than average and within sites located in sloped, treed settings. Topographic predictors were highly important for distinguishing unburned, moderate, and high site burn severity as classified in post-fire archaeological assessments. High-severity impacts were more likely at archaeological sites with southern orientation or on warmer, steeper, slopes with less accumulated surface moisture, likely associated with lower fuel moistures and high potential for spreading fire. Conclusions Models for predicting where and when fires may negatively affect the archaeological record can be used to prioritize fuel treatments, inform fire management plans, and guide post-fire rehabilitation efforts, thus aiding in cultural resource preservation.";s42408-021-00103-6.txt
SB9UIUMI;journalArticle;2021;"Abitbol, Roy; Shimshoni, Ilan; Ben-Dov, Jonathan";Machine Learning Based Assembly of Fragments of Ancient Papyrus;Acm Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage;The task of assembling fragments in a puzzle-like manner into a composite picture plays a significant role in the field of archaeology as it supports researchers in their attempt to reconstruct historic artifacts. In this article, we propose a method for matching and assembling pairs of ancient papyrus fragments containing mostly unknown scriptures. Papyrus paper is manufactured from papyrus plants and therefore portrays typical thread patterns resulting from the plant's stems. The proposed algorithm is founded on the hypothesis that these thread patterns contain unique local attributes such that nearby fragments show similar patterns reflecting the continuations of the threads. We posit that these patterns can be exploited using image processing and machine learning techniques to identify matching fragments. The algorithm and system which we present support the quick and automated classification of matching pairs of papyrus fragments as well as the geometric alignment of the pairs against each other. The algorithm consists of a series of steps and is based on deep-learning and machine learning methods. The first step is to deconstruct the problem of matching fragments into a smaller problem of finding thread continuation matches in local edge areas (squares) between pairs of fragments. This phase is solved using a convolutional neural network ingesting raw images of the edge areas and producing local matching scores. The result of this stage yields very high recall but low precision. Thus, we utilize these scores in order to conclude about the matching of entire fragments pairs by establishing an elaborate voting mechanism. We enhance this voting with geometric alignment techniques from which we extract additional spatial information. Eventually, we feed all the data collected from these steps into a Random Forest classifier in order to produce a higher order classifier capable of predicting whether a pair of fragments is a match. Our algorithm was trained on a batch of fragments which was excavated from the Dead Sea caves and is dated circa the 1st century BCE. The algorithm shows excellent results on a validation set which is of a similar origin and conditions. We then tried to run the algorithm against a real-life set of fragments for which we have no prior knowledge or labeling of matches. This test batch is considered extremely challenging due to its poor condition and the small size of its fragments. Evidently, numerous researchers have tried seeking matches within this batch with very little success. Our algorithm performance on this batch was sub-optimal, returning a relatively large ratio of false positives. However, the algorithm was quite useful by eliminating 98% of the possiblematches thus reducing the amount of work needed formanual inspection. Indeed, experts that reviewed the results have identified some positive matches as potentially true and referred them for further investigation.;Abitbol et al. - 2021 - Machine Learning Based Assembly of Fragments of An.txt

The so-called scan-to-BIM process can, in fact, benefit from such data, and they can themselves be a source for further analyses or activities on the archaeological and built heritage. There are several ways to exploit this type of data, such as Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM), mesh creation, rasterisation, classification, and semantic segmentation. The latter, referring to point clouds, is a trending topic not only in the CH domain but also in other fields like autonomous navigation, medicine or retail.

In particular, machine learning (ML) algorithms, and their deep learning (DL) subset, are increasingly applied and have established a solid state-of-the-art in the last half-decade. However, applications of DL techniques on heritage point clouds are still scarce; therefore, we propose to tackle this framework within the built heritage field.

Mapping the piles of such sites is an indispensable basis to the exploitation of the high resolution absolute chronological data gained through dendrochronology. In a case study at the underwater site of Plo.ca, Mi.cov Grad at Lake Ohrid, North Macedonia, nine consecutive 10 m(2) strips and a 6 m(2) excavation section were uncovered, the situation documented, and the wood piles sampled. The gained data was vectorized in a geographic information system. During two field campaigns, a total of 794 wooden elements on a surface of 96 m(2) could be documented three-dimensionally with a residual error of less than 2 cm. The exceptionally high number of fishes in the 5 m deep water resulted in a significant covering of potentially important information on the relevant photos. We present a machine learning approach, especially developed and successfully applied to the automatic detection and masking of these fishes in order to eliminate them from the images. The discussed documentation workflow enables an efficient, cost-effective, accurate and reproducible mapping of pile fields. So far, no other method applied to the recording of pile fields has allowed for a comparably high resolution of spatial information.;Reich et al. - 2021 - A novel Structure from Motion-based approach to un.txt

Although previous attempts were able to detect a good proportion of the known mounds in a given area, they still presented high numbers of false positives and low precision values. Our proposed approach combines random forest for soil classification using multitemporal multispectral Sentinel-2 data and a deep learning model using YOLOv3 on LiDAR data previously pre-processed using a multi-scale relief model. The resulting algorithm significantly improves previous attempts with a detection rate of 89.5%, an average precision of 66.75%, a recall value of 0.64 and a precision of 0.97, which allowed, with a small set of training data, the detection of 10,527 burial mounds over an area of near 30,000 km(2), the largest in which such an approach has ever been applied. The open code and platforms employed to develop the algorithm allow this method to be applied anywhere LiDAR data or high-resolution digital terrain models are available.</p>;Berganzo-Besga et al. - 2021 - Hybrid MSRM-Based Deep Learning and Multitemporal .txt
D26WQQ2X;journalArticle;2022;Payntar, Nicole D.;Archaeological heritage 'on-the-rise': detecting emerging tourist attractions in Peru using machine learning and geotagged photographs;Journal of Heritage Tourism;Unlike large cities and urban heritage attractions, archaeological heritage sites in peripheral locations cannot readily absorb the impact of over-tourism. Peru's rapid growth as a tourist destination since the late 1990s has been bolstered by the popularity of its archaeological heritage sites and past civilizations, particularly in the Cuzco region. As mass tourism and issues of overcrowding have confronted visitors and heritage managers in the Cuzco region, tourists have sought alternative archaeological attractions beyond Cuzco's ticketed sites - many of which are open-access and unmonitored. By integrating large-scale internet photo datasets from Flickr and the power of computer vision and machine learning algorithms, this study identifies 'on-the-rise' (i.e. emerging) archaeological heritage attractions accessible from five Peruvian cities. The major contributions of this paper are (1) to provide a novel method capable of being scaled globally to identify emerging archaeological tourist attractions that are unmonitored by ticket sales, (2) to identify 'on-the-rise' archaeological attractions in Peru, and (3) to mitigate future risk (e.g. over-tourism, pollution, destruction and damage) at identified sites as tourist itineraries continue to expand. The identification of emerging archaeological heritage attractions is significant for targeted and sustainable heritage planning, archaeological conservation, future destination marketing and tourism development.;Payntar_2022.txt

Future developments will involve expanded work with other academic disciplines, such as archaeology, as well as applications to practical problems arising from future climatic change and related environmental hazards, particularly extremes. Remote sensing and high-resolution topography data and tools (e.g. LiDAR) will facilitate new discoveries of ancient exceptional flooding phenomena (megaflooding and superfloods) on Earth and on the palaeofluvial forms of Earth-like planets.

They are also of great value for cultural heritage management and planning purposes. This is particularly true for Palaeolithic sites in the east Austrian loess landscape, which are often deeply embedded in sediment sequences. In this study, we analyse the geospatial behaviour of 23 Upper Palaeolithic sites in Lower Austria. Hereby, we apply a new approach, which combines the advantages of a classical deductive method with the capabilities of machine learning, implemented via the MaxEnt software. The result is a predictive model for an area of 7850 km(2), exploring the potential for the presence of Upper Palaeolithic sites. The model highlights several spatial dynamics of site probability in the study area. Possible sources of inaccuracies within the source data and the methodology are critically discussed.;BOEMKE_2022.txt

In this study we apply inductive modelling to compare the spatial structure of the settlement systems of hunter-fisher-gatherer groups (Narva and Combed Ware Culture) and early agrarian communities (Corded Ware Culture) in Stone Age Estonia.We conceptualise settlement system formation as a point process and develop a first order point process model representing the environmental suitability for habitation based on geomorphological, soil and proximity to water. We use MaxEnt and the SDMTune machine learning framework for building the model, variable selection and estimation. The model is applied to the two communities and the effects of the variables and the resulting spatial patterns compared.The statistical analysis indicated higher predictive power for hunter-fisher-gatherer sites, which might result from higher variety of agrarian activities, different socio-economic organization or effects of spatial structure of the landscape.The spatial comparison indicates significant differences between the suitable environments for habitation between the two groups. While the hunter-fisher-gatherer population had an entirely shoreline connected settlement system the Corded Ware people inhabited the areas further away from water bodies. This resulted in significantly expanded potential space with differing spatial configuration for the incoming agrarian groups, possibly allowing tolerated immigration. The results also indicate there was a certain overlap of areas considered suitable habitation by both cultural groups, which might have caused a competition for land.;Sikk et al. - 2022 - Comparing contemporaneous hunter-gatherer and earl.txt

Many stone wall structures have either disappeared, suffered substantial damage, or had segments removed. Additionally, as it stands today, the registry of these structures, managed by each municipality, is outdated and incomplete. Leveraging recent developments in Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we analyze the publicly available terrain data (40 cm resolution) derived from the Danish LiDAR data, using a U-Net-like CNN model to assess the stone walls dataset and provide for an update of the registry. While the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) alone provided good results, better results were obtained when adding Height Above Terrain (HAT) and an additional DTM layer with a Sobel filter applied. Using a pixel-wise evaluation, there was an overall agreement of 93% between ground truth and prediction of stone walls in a validation area and 88% overall agreement for the whole predicted area. Good generalizability was found when externally validating the model on new data, showing positive results for both the existing stone walls and predicting new potential ones upon visualisation. The method performed best in open areas, however positive results were also seen in forested areas, although denser areas and urban areas presented as challenging. Given the lack of a reference dataset or other studies on this specific matter, the evaluation of our study was heavily based on the stone walls registry itself complemented by visual inspection of the predictions and on the ground in the Danish municipality of ae ro. Automating the process of identifying and updating the stone walls registry in Denmark is of great relevance to the local governments. We suggest the development of a Decision Support System to allow municipalities access to the results of this method.;Trotter et al. - 2022 - Machine learning for automatic detection of histor.txt

Despite promising results in the detection phase, there is still a lack of a standard set of measures to evaluate the performance of object detection methods, since buried archaeological sites often have distinctive shapes that set them aside from other types of objects included in mainstream remote sensing datasets (e.g., Dataset of Object deTection in Aerial images, DOTA). Additionally, archaeological research relies heavily on geospatial information when validating the output of an object detection procedure, a type of information that is not normally considered in regular machine learning validation pipelines. This paper tackles these shortcomings by introducing two novel automatic evaluation measures, namely 'centroid-based' and 'pixel-based', designed to encode the salient aspects of the archaeologists' thinking process. To test their usability, an experiment with different object detection deep neural networks was conducted on a LiDAR dataset. The experimental results show that these two automatic measures closely resemble the semi-automatic one currently used by archaeologists and therefore can be adopted as fully automatic evaluation measures in archaeological remote sensing detection. Adoption will facilitate cross-study comparisons and close collaboration between machine learning and archaeological researchers, which in turn will encourage the development of novel human-centred archaeological object detection tools.;Fiorucci et al. - 2022 - Deep Learning for Archaeological Object Detection .txt

The example confirms that supervised methods are able to distinguish classes with similar features, and provenancing is achievable. The provided code contains self-explanatory notes to guide the users through the classification algorithms. Archaeometrists without previous knowledge of R should be able to apply the novel methodology to similar well-constrained classification problems.

The results of such a process are used in archaeology for analyzing the origin and manufacturing techniques of ancient ceramics. In this paper we present a methodology for the segmentation and analysis of thin sections of material segments and reaching some conclusions in a fully automatic way. We employ machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze a video of the thin section sample, acquired under an optical microscope. When examined under polarized light, the color of segments may vary during sample rotation. This variation is due to the optical properties of the materials and it provides valuable information about the material inclusions in the sample. Using the video as our input, we perform an entire-video segmentation. To accomplish this task, we developed a hierarchical categorical mean-shift-based algorithm. Using the entire-video segmentation we examine the detected segments and gather statistical information about their sizes, shapes and colors and present an overall report about the sample. We tested the algorithm on nine specimens of ancient ceramics, taken from three different Mediterranean sites. The results show clear differences between the sites in the amounts, sizes and shapes of the segments present in the specimens.;Lerner et Shimshoni - 2022 - Thin section analysis for ceramic petrography usin.txt

We evaluate past uses of radar, multispectral, and LiDAR datasets in Northwest Belize across well-studied wetland field complexes that occur under different vegetation conditions. Next, we compare topographic products derived from LiDAR data commonly used for archaeology and geomorphology. Lastly, we train a machine learning algorithm to detect ancient canals with LiDAR data and test the algorithm on a newly rediscovered field system. The spatial resolution of any dataset must be sufficiently high (2-m or finer resolution) to detect most of these canals reliably. High resolution multispectral sensors can detect canals in open areas, but most wetland complexes are under dense tropical forest impenetrable to multispectral instruments. LiDAR data were the most useful due to the high spatial resolution (0.5-m) and the ability to penetrate canopy, but still have limitations under certain conditions. The intensity of the LiDAR returns with multispectral LiDAR systems can reveal differences in soil and vegetation between ancient canals and fields in places leveled by modern farmers. The algorithm successfully maps ancient canals but has many false positives in natural depressions and drainages. Although the machine learning approach tested here cannot be used on its own, we used it with the LiDAR visualizations to refine the canal estimates from previous studies, mapping nearly 50% more canals in the Central Rio Bravo floodplain than originally published.;Doyle et al. - Advances in remote sensing of the early Anthropoce.txt

However, recent technological advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular deep learning methods, open possibilities for the automated analysis of large areas of remote sensing data. This paper examines the applicability and potential of supervised deep learning methods for the detection and mapping of different kinds of archaeological sites comprising features such as walls and linear or curvilinear structures of different dimensions, spectral and geometrical properties. Our work deliberately uses open-source imagery to demonstrate the accessibility of these tools. One of the main challenges facing AI approaches has been that they require large amounts of labeled data to achieve high levels of accuracy so that the training stage requires significant computational resources. Our results show, however, that even with relatively limited amounts of data, simple eight-layer, fully convolutional network can be trained efficiently using minimal computational resources, to identify and classify archaeological sites and successfully distinguish them from features with similar characteristics. By increasing the number of training sets and switching to the use of high-performance computing the accuracy of the identified areas increases. We conclude by discussing the future directions and potential of such methods in archaeological research.;Karamitrou et al. - 2022 - Towards the use of artificial intelligence deep le.txt

Exploring New Frontiers in Human Heritage;Until now, computer vision and machine learning techniques barely contributed to the archaeological domain. The use of these techniques can support archaeologists in their assessment and classification of archaeological finds. The paper illustrates the use of computer vision techniques for archaeology with two examples: (1) a content-based image retrieval system for historical glass and (2) an automatic system for medieval coin classification. The content-based image retrieval system automatically finds artifact drawings in a reference collection that are most similar to a photograph or drawing of an excavated historical glass. The similarity measurements are based on the outer shape contours of the artifacts. The system can speed up the process of classifying historical glass, and make it more objective and controllable. The coin classification system will be trained on a collection of Dutch early-medieval coins. For this system, we present preliminary results on modern coin data.;VAN_MAATEN_20074.txt

Analysts, thus, lose the opportunity to resolve an important part of the equifinality related to activities that hominins and different types of carnivores may produce. Recent studies have shown that the use of powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms allow the accurate classification of bone surface modifications (BSM). Here, we present an experimental study, applying these algorithms to the analysis of bone breakage patterns. This statistical methodology allows the correct classification of three different assemblages which have been generated anthropogenically and by the activity of carnivores (i.e., hyenas and wolves). ML algorithms applied to a multivariate set of properties of broken bone specimens yielded an accuracy of 95% and were higher in classifying agency without the need to include information from BSM. This paper proposes a methodological approach that opens the door to improve our understanding of referential frameworks regarding bone breakage and to determine agency in prehistoric bone breakage processes.;10.1007@s12520-019-00815-6.txt
DUTZIC5L;journalArticle;2021;"Adams, Henry; Moy, Michael";Topology Applied to Machine Learning: From Global to Local.;Frontiers in artificial intelligence;Through the use of examples, we explain one way in which applied topology has evolved since the birth of persistent homology in the early 2000s. The first  applications of topology to data emphasized the global shape of a dataset, such  as the three-circle model for 3 × 3 pixel patches from natural images, or the  configuration space of the cyclo-octane molecule, which is a sphere with a Klein  bottle attached via two circles of singularity. In these studies of global shape,  short persistent homology bars are disregarded as sampling noise. More recently,  however, persistent homology has been used to address questions about the local  geometry of data. For instance, how can local geometry be vectorized for use in  machine learning problems? Persistent homology and its vectorization methods,  including persistence landscapes and persistence images, provide popular  techniques for incorporating both local geometry and global topology into machine  learning. Our meta-hypothesis is that the short bars are as important as the long  bars for many machine learning tasks. In defense of this claim, we survey  applications of persistent homology to shape recognition, agent-based modeling,  materials science, archaeology, and biology. Additionally, we survey work  connecting persistent homology to geometric features of spaces, including  curvature and fractal dimension, and various methods that have been used to  incorporate persistent homology into machine learning.;Adams et Moy - 2021 - Topology Applied to Machine Learning From Global .txt

It was found that the classification performance may  vary significantly depending on the problem. From the methods tested, LDA and the  machine learning technique of linear SVM exhibit the best performance, with high  prediction accuracy and relatively low bias in most of the tests.

We report a machine learning based technology  for stone artifact identification as part of a solution to the lack of such  experts directed at distinguishing worked stone objects from naturally occurring  lithic clasts. Three case study locations from Egypt, Australia, and New Zealand  provide a data set of 6769 2D images, 3868 flaked artifact and 2901 rock images  used to train and test a machine learning model based on an openly available  PyTorch implementation of Faster R-CNN ResNet 50. Results indicate 100% agreement  between the model and original human derived classifications, a better  performance than the results achieved independently by two human analysts who  reassessed the 2D images available to the machine learning model. Machine  learning neural networks provide the potential to consistently assess the  composition of large archaeological assemblages composed of objects modified in a  variety of ways.;Emmitt et al. - 2022 - Machine learning for stone artifact identification.txt
BBG9726I;journalArticle;2021;"Elliot, Tom; Morse, Robert; Smythe, Duane; Norris, Ashley";Evaluating machine learning techniques for archaeological lithic sourcing: a case study of flint in Britain.;Scientific reports;It is 50 years since Sieveking et al. published their pioneering research in Nature on the geochemical analysis of artefacts from Neolithic flint mines in  southern Britain. In the decades since, geochemical techniques to source stone  artefacts have flourished globally, with a renaissance in recent years from new  instrumentation, data analysis, and machine learning techniques. Despite the  interest over these latter approaches, there has been variation in the quality  with which these methods have been applied. Using the case study of flint  artefacts and geological samples from England, we present a robust and objective  evaluation of three popular techniques, Random Forest, K-Nearest-Neighbour, and  Support Vector Machines, and present a pipeline for their appropriate use. When  evaluated correctly, the results establish high model classification performance,  with Random Forest leading with an average accuracy of 85% (measured through F1  Scores), and with Support Vector Machines following closely. The methodology  developed in this paper demonstrates the potential to significantly improve on  previous approaches, particularly in removing bias, and providing greater means  of evaluation than previously utilised.;s41598-021-87834-3.txt
RXIXETT7;journalArticle;2021;"Vos, Daniella; Stafford, Richard; Jenkins, Emma L.; Garrard, Andrew";A model based on Bayesian confirmation and machine learning algorithms to aid archaeological interpretation by integrating incompatible data.;PloS one;The interpretation of archaeological features often requires a combined methodological approach in order to make the most of the material record,  particularly from sites where this may be limited. In practice, this requires the  consultation of different sources of information in order to cross validate  findings and combat issues of ambiguity and equifinality. However, the  application of a multiproxy approach often generates incompatible data, and might  therefore still provide ambiguous results. This paper explores the potential of a  simple digital framework to increase the explanatory power of multiproxy data by  enabling the incorporation of incompatible, ambiguous datasets in a single model.  In order to achieve this, Bayesian confirmation was used in combination with  decision trees. The results of phytolith and geochemical analyses carried out on  soil samples from ephemeral sites in Jordan are used here as a case study. The  combination of the two datasets as part of a single model enabled us to refine  the initial interpretation of the use of space at the archaeological sites by  providing an alternative identification for certain activity areas. The potential  applications of this model are much broader, as it can also help researchers in  other domains reach an integrated interpretation of analysis results by combining  different datasets.;Vos et al. - 2021 - A model based on Bayesian confirmation and machine.txt

For example, a forensic pathologist may benefit from  deep learning-based tools in gunshot wound interpretation. This proof-of-concept  study aimed to test the hypothesis that trained neural network architectures have  potential to predict shooting distance class on the basis of a simple photograph  of the gunshot wound. A dataset of 204 gunshot wound images (60 negative  controls, 50 contact shots, 49 close-range shots, and 45 distant shots) was  constructed on the basis of nineteen piglet carcasses fired with a .22 Long Rifle  pistol. The dataset was used to train, validate, and test the ability of neural  net architectures to correctly classify images on the basis of shooting distance.  Deep learning was performed using the AIDeveloper open-source software. Of the  explored neural network architectures, a trained multilayer perceptron based  model (MLP_24_16_24) reached the highest testing accuracy of 98%. Of the testing  set, the trained model was able to correctly classify all negative controls,  contact shots, and close-range shots, whereas one distant shot was misclassified.  Our study clearly demonstrated that in the future, forensic pathologists may  benefit from deep learning-based tools in gunshot wound interpretation.

Unlike satellite imagery,  aerial imagery can be captured and processed within hours rather than days. In  addition, the spatial resolution of aerial imagery is an order of magnitude  higher than the imagery produced by the most sophisticated commercial satellites  today. Both the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the  European Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC) have noted that aerial imagery  will inevitably present a big data challenge. The purpose of this article is to  get ahead of this future challenge by proposing a hybrid crowdsourcing and  real-time machine learning solution to rapidly process large volumes of aerial  data for disaster response in a time-sensitive manner. Crowdsourcing can be used  to annotate features of interest in aerial images (such as damaged shelters and  roads blocked by debris). These human-annotated features can then be used to  train a supervised machine learning system to learn to recognize such features in  new unseen images. In this article, we describe how this hybrid solution for  image analysis can be implemented as a module (i.e., Aerial Clicker) to extend an  existing platform called Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response (AIDR),  which has already been deployed to classify microblog messages during disasters  using its Text Clicker module and in response to Cyclone Pam, a category 5  cyclone that devastated Vanuatu in March 2015. The hybrid solution we present can  be applied to both aerial and satellite imagery and has applications beyond  disaster response such as wildlife protection, human rights, and archeological  exploration. As a proof of concept, we recently piloted this solution using very  high-resolution aerial photographs of a wildlife reserve in Namibia to support  rangers with their wildlife conservation efforts (SAVMAP project,  http://lasig.epfl.ch/savmap ). The results suggest that the platform we have  developed to combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to make sense of large  volumes of aerial images can be used for disaster response.;Ofli et al. - 2016 - Combining Human Computing and Machine Learning to .txt

In this study, the objects were smartphone  photographs of near-complete Roman terra sigillata pottery vessels from the  collection of the Museum of London. Taking the replicated features from published  profile drawings of pottery forms allowed the integration of expert knowledge  into the process through our synthetic data generator. After this first initial  training the model was fine-tuned with data from photographs of real vessels. We  show, through exhaustive experiments across several popular deep learning  architectures, different test priors, and considering the impact of the  photograph viewpoint and excessive damage to the vessels, that the proposed  hybrid approach enables the creation of classifiers with appropriate  generalisation performance. This performance is significantly better than that of  classifiers trained exclusively on the original data, which shows the promise of  the approach to alleviate the fundamental issue of learning from small datasets.;Núñez Jareño et al. - 2021 - Learning from Scarce Information Using Synthetic .txt

Here we combine  Raman spectroscopy and machine learning to build temperature-estimation models to  infer the degree of pyro-technological control effected by inhabitants of the  late Lower Palaeolithic (Acheulo-Yabrudian) site of Qesem Cave, Israel.  Temperature estimation shows that blades were heated at lower median temperatures  (259?°C) compared to flakes (413?°C), whereas heat-induced structural flint  damage (for example, pot-lids and microcracks) appears at 447?°C.

Three remote sensing datasets (Landsat optical data, ALOS  L-band data and LiDAR derived Canopy Height Model (CHM)) were used in conjunction  with three different machine learning (ML) regression techniques (Support Vector  Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)). These  ML methods were implemented on (a) Landsat spectral data, (b) Landsat spectral  band & ALOS backscatter data, and (c) Landsat spectral band, ALOS backscatter  data, & LiDAR CHM data.

Discrimination between these varieties, historically done by ampelography, is  done in recent decades mostly by genetic analysis.

A  variety of empirically-based and process-based models have been proposed to build  terrestrial 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes but, in their current forms, those models are not  mature enough to be integrated with continuous-probability surface models used in  geographic assignment. In this study, we aim to overcome those limitations and to  predict 87Sr/86Sr variations across Western Europe by combining process-based  models and a series of remote-sensing geospatial products into a regression  framework. We find that random forest regression significantly outperforms other  commonly used regression and interpolation methods, and efficiently predicts the  multi-scale patterning of 87Sr/86Sr variations by accounting for geological,  geomorphological and atmospheric controls. Random forest regression also provides  an easily interpretable and flexible framework to integrate different types of  environmental auxiliary variables required to model the multi-scale patterning of  87Sr/86Sr variability. The method is transferable to different scales and  resolutions and can be applied to the large collection of geospatial data  available at local and global levels. The isoscape generated in this study  provides the most accurate 87Sr/86Sr predictions in bioavailable strontium for  Western Europe (R2 = 0.58 and RMSE = 0.0023) to date, as well as a conservative  estimate of spatial uncertainty by applying quantile regression forest.

Crucial evolutionary features, such as the origin of stone tool use,  meat-eating, food-sharing, cooperation and sociality can only be addressed  through confident identification and interpretation of BSM, and more  specifically, cut marks. Recently, it has been argued that linear marks with the  same properties as cut marks can be created by crocodiles, thereby questioning  whether secure cut mark identifications can be made in the Early Pleistocene  fossil record. Powerful classification methods based on multivariate statistics  and machine learning (ML) algorithms have previously successfully discriminated  cut marks from most other potentially confounding BSM. However, crocodile-made  marks were marginal to or played no role in these comparative analyses. Here, for  the first time, we apply state-of-the-art ML methods on crocodile linear BSM and  experimental butchery cut marks, showing that the combination of multivariate  taphonomy and ML methods provides accurate identification of BSM, including cut  and crocodile bite marks.

Exemplarily, this is carried out using a database of 1365 Neolithic sites in the  Weiße Elster river catchment in Central Germany located between the southernmost  part of the Northern German Plain and the Central Uplands. The recorded sites are  systematically pre-processed with regard to their chronology, functional  interpretation and spatial delineation. The quality of the dataset is reviewed by  analyzing site distributions with respect to field surveys and modern land use.  The Random Forests machine learning algorithm is used to examine the impact of  terrain covariates on the depth of sites and pottery preservation. Neolithic  settlement dynamics are studied using Site Exploitation Territories, and site  frequencies per century are used to compare the intensity of land use with  adjacent landscapes. The results show that the main trends of the Neolithic  settlement dynamics can be derived from the dataset. However, Random Forests  analyses indicate poor pottery preservation in the Central Uplands and a  superimposition of Neolithic sites in the southernmost part of the Northern  German Plain. Throughout the Neolithic the margins between soils on loess and the  Weiße Elster floodplain were continuously settled, whereas only Early and Late  Neolithic land use also extended into the Central Uplands. These settlement  patterns are reflected in the results of the Site Exploitation Territories  analyses and explained with environmental economic factors.

It accounts for spatial dependence by using covariates on multiple  spatial scales and incorporates spatial context and structural dependence to  environmental properties into machine learning models. For spatial soil  modelling, three relevant scales or ranges of scale exist: quasi-local soil  formation processes that are independent of the spatial context, short-range  catenary processes, and long-range processes related to climate and large-scale  terrain settings. Recent studies investigated the spatial dependence of topsoil  properties only. We hypothesize that soil properties within a soil profile were  formed due to specific interactions between different features and scales of the  spatial context, and that there are depth gradients in spatial and structural  dependencies. The results showed that for topsoil, features at small to  intermediate scales do not increase model accuracy, whereas large scales increase  model accuracy. In contrast, subsoil models benefit from all scales-small,  intermediate, and large. Based on the differences in relevance, we conclude that  the relevant ranges of scales do not only differ in the horizontal domain, but  also in the vertical domain across the soil profile.

Maximum cross-validated classification accuracy from step-wise DFA reached 94.8%  for the femur, 94.7% for the tibia, and 97.3% for the humerus, whereas SVM  cross-validated results were similar although slightly lower, mainly due to the  more strict cross-validation scheme. Our results suggest that the proposed sex  estimation method is reasonably robust to secular change, since there was limited  loss in classification accuracy between different chronological groups, despite  the presence of secular change in stature of the Greek population during the  examined period. The proposed method has been implemented as a function for the  GNU Octave environment, named estimate_sex, which comprises a self-intuitive  graphical user interface for facilitating sex estimation and is freely available  under a suitable license.;Bertsatos et al. - 2021 - Advancements in sex estimation using the diaphysea.txt

As shooting distance is among the main factors  behind shotgun patterning, this proof-of-concept study aimed to explore the  potential of neural net architectures to correctly classify shotgun pattern  images in terms of shooting distance. The study material comprised a total of 106  shotgun pattern images from two discrete shooting distances (n = 54 images from  10 m and n = 52 images from 17.5 m) recorded on blank white paper. The dataset  was used to train, validate and test deep learning algorithms to correctly  classify images in terms of shooting distance. The open source AIDeveloper  software was used for the deep learning procedure. In this dataset, a  TinyResNet-based algorithm reached the highest testing accuracy of 94%. Of the  testing set, the algorithm classified all 10 m patterns correctly, and  misclassified one 17.5 m pattern. On the basis of these preliminary data, it  seems achievable to develop algorithms that would serve as a beneficial tool for  forensic investigators when estimating shooting distances from shotgun patterns.  In the future, studies with larger and more complex datasets are needed to  develop robust and applicable algorithms for forensic shotgun pattern  interpretation.;Oura et al. - 2021 - Deep learning in forensic shotgun pattern interpre.txt

The proposed method was developed and evaluated using two  European population samples, a Czech sample comprising 170 crania reconstructed  from anonymized CT scans and a Greek sample of 156 crania from the Athens  Collection. It is based on a fully automatic algorithm applied on 3D models for  extracting sex diagnostic morphometric features which are further processed by  computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Classification accuracy was  evaluated in a population specific and a population generic 2-way  cross-validation scheme. Population-specific accuracy for individual morphometric  features ranged from 78.5 to 96.7%, whereas population generic correct  classification ranged from 71.7 to 90.8%. Combining all sex diagnostic traits in  multi-feature sex estimation yielded correct classification performance in excess  of 91% for the entire sample, whereas the sex of about three fourths of the  sample could be determined with 100% accuracy according to posterior probability  estimates. The proposed method provides an efficient and reliable way to estimate  sex from cranial remains, and it offers significant advantages over existing  methods. The proposed method can be readily implemented with the skullanalyzer  computer program and the estimate_sex.m GNU Octave function, which are freely  available under a suitable license.;Bertsatos et al. - 2020 - Advanced procedures for skull sex estimation using.txt

The last decades have seen a rise of multiple government programs to protect wolf  populations. Nevertheless, these programs have been controversial in rural areas,  product of the predation of livestock by carnivores. As a response to such  issues, governments have presented large scale economic plans to compensate the  respected owners. The current issue lies in the lack of reliable techniques that  can be used to detect the predator responsible for livestock predation. This has  led to complications when obtaining subsidies, creating conflict between  landowners and government officials. The objectives of this study therefore are  to provide a new alternative approach to differentiating between tooth marks of  different predators responsible for livestock predation. Here we present the use  of geometric morphometrics and Machine Learning algorithms to discern between  different carnivores through in depth analysis of the tooth marks they leave on  bone.

We present an approach for fossil pollen analysis that uses optical  superresolution microscopy and machine learning to create a quantitative and  higher throughput workflow for producing palynological identifications and  hypotheses of biological affinity. We developed three convolutional neural  network (CNN) classification models: maximum projection (MPM), multislice (MSM),  and fused (FM). We trained the models on the pollen of 16 genera of the legume  tribe Amherstieae, and then used these models to constrain the biological  classifications of 48 fossil Striatopollis specimens from the Paleocene, Eocene,  and Miocene of western Africa and northern South America. All models achieved  average accuracies of 83 to 90% in the classification of the extant genera, and  the majority of fossil identifications (86%) showed consensus among at least two  of the three models. Our fossil identifications support the paleobiogeographic  hypothesis that Amherstieae originated in Paleocene Africa and dispersed to South  America during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (56 Ma). They also raise the  possibility that at least three Amherstieae genera (Crudia, Berlinia, and  Anthonotha) may have diverged earlier in the Cenozoic than predicted by molecular  phylogenies.;Romero et al. - 2020 - Improving the taxonomy of fossil pollen using conv.txt

It can be applied in many fields such as forensic medicine, archaeology, and face  animation. Craniofacial reconstruction is based on the relationship between the  skull and the face to reconstruct the facial appearance from the skull. However,  the craniofacial structure is very complex and the relationship is not the same  in different craniofacial regions. To better represent the shape changes of the  skull and face and make better use of the correlation between different local  regions, a new craniofacial reconstruction method based on region fusion strategy  is proposed in this paper. This method has the flexibility of finding the  nonlinear relationship between skull and face variables and is easy to solve.  Firstly, the skull and face are divided into five corresponding local regions;  secondly, the five regions of skull and face are mapped to low-dimensional latent  space using Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM), and the nonlinear  features between skull and face are extracted; then, least square support vector  regression (LSSVR) model is trained in latent space to establish the mapping  relationship between skull region and face region; finally, perform regional  fusion to achieve overall reconstruction. For the unknown skull, first divide the  region, then project it into the latent space of the skull region, then use the  trained LSSVR model to reconstruct the face of the corresponding region, and  finally perform regional fusion to realize the face reconstruction of the unknown  skull. The experimental results show that the method is effective. Compared with  other regression methods, our method is optimal. In addition, we add attributes  such as age and body mass index (BMI) to the mappings to achieve face  reconstruction with different attributes.";Wen et al. - 2020 - Craniofacial Reconstruction Method Based on Region.txt

All data were extracted from  the publicly available cross-cultural database D-PLACE. Our results suggest that  not all subsistence combinations are viable, existing just a subset of successful  economic choices that appear recurrently in specific ecological systems. The  subsistence economies identified are classified as either primary or mixed  economies in accordance with an information-entropy-based quantitative criterion  that determines their degree of diversification.

Critical  interpretations of when humans started eating meat and animal fat or when they  started using stone tools, or when they occupied new continents or interacted  with predatory guilds impinge on accurate identifications of BSM. Until now,  interpretations of Plio-Pleistocene BSM have been contentious because of the high  uncertainty in discriminating among taphonomic agents. Recently, the use of  machine learning algorithms has yielded high accuracy in the identification of  BSM. A branch of machine learning methods based on imaging, computer vision (CV),  has opened the door to a more objective and accurate method of BSM  identification. The present work has selected two extremely similar types of BSM  (cut marks made on fleshed an defleshed bones) to test the immense potential of  artificial intelligence methods. This CV approach not only produced the highest  accuracy in the classification of these types of BSM until present (95% on  complete images of BSM and 88.89% of images of only internal mark features), but  it also has enabled a method for determining which inconspicuous microscopic  features determine successful BSM discrimination.

Environmental big data is a kind of new method and thought, which brings both  opportunities and challenges to GIS-based spatial analysis in geochemical  studies. However, big data research in environmental geochemistry is still in its  preliminary stage, and what practical problems can be solved still remain  unclear. This short review paper briefly discusses the main problems and  solutions of spatial analysis related to the big data in environmental  geochemistry, with a focus on the development and applications of conventional  GIS-based approaches as well as advanced spatial machine learning techniques. The  topics discussed include probability distribution and data transformation,  spatial structures and patterns, correlation and spatial relationships, data  visualisation, spatial prediction, background and threshold, hot spots and  spatial outliers as well as distinction of natural and anthropogenic factors. It  is highlighted that the integration of spatial analysis on the GIS platform  provides effective solutions to revealing the hidden spatial patterns and  spatially varying relationships in environmental geochemistry, demonstrated by an  example of cadmium concentrations in the topsoil of Northern Ireland through hot  spot analysis. In the big data era, further studies should be more inclined to  the integration and application of spatial machine learning techniques, as well  as investigation on the temporal trends of environmental geochemical features.;Xu et Zhang - 2022 - Development and applications of GIS-based spatial .txt

To this end, we explore the machine learning  problem of instance classification for large archaeological images datasets, i.e.  where each individual object (instance) is itself a class that all of the  multiple images of that object belongs. We focus on a wide variety of objects in  the Durham Oriental Museum with which we build a dataset with over 24,502 images  of 4332 unique object instances. We experiment with state-of-the-art  convolutional neural network models, the smaller variations of which are suitable  for deployment on mobile applications. We find the exact object instance of a  given image can be predicted from among 4332 others with ~ 72% accuracy, showing  how effectively machine learning can detect a known object from a new image. We  demonstrate that accuracy significantly improves as the number of  images-per-object instance increases (up to ~ 83%), with an ensemble of  classifiers scoring as high as 84%.

With the rapid growth of data volume, effective methods  are required for data analytics for the large geochemical data sets. In recent  years, spatial machine learning technologies have been proven to have the  potential to reveal hidden spatial patterns in order to extract geochemical  information. In this study, two spatial clustering techniques of Getis-Ord G(i)*  statistic and K-means clustering analysis were performed on 15 PTEs in 6,862  topsoil samples from the Tellus datasets of Northern Ireland to investigate the  hidden spatial patterns and association with their controlling factors. The  spatial clustering patterns of hot spots (high values) and cold spots (low  values) for the 15 PTEs were revealed, showing clear association with geological  features, especially peat and basalt. Peat was associated with high  concentrations of Bi, Pb, Sb and Sn, while basalt was associated with high  concentrations of Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, V and Zn. The high concentrations of As,  Ba, Mo and U were associated with mixture of various lithologies, indicating the  complicated influences on them. In addition, three hidden patterns in the 6,862  soil samples were revealed by K-means clustering analysis. The soil samples in  the first and second clusters were overlaid on the peatland and basalt formation,  respectively, while the samples in the third cluster were overlaid on the mixture  of the other lithologies. These hidden patterns of soil samples were consistent  with the spatial clustering patterns for PTEs, highlighting the dominant control  of peat and basalt in the topsoil of Northern Ireland.

Since their discovery, natural agents  such as trampling phenomena have been a topic of great taphonomic interest.  Nevertheless, the majority of investigation into these traces has focused almost  exclusively on their differentiation from other anthropic agents such as cut  marks. In recent years, advances into bone surface modification analysis via  geometric morphometrics have proven useful for in-depth characterization of  different taphonomic traces; including cut, tooth and percussion marks. Through  this, a preliminary study of trampling marks using advanced 3D digital microscopy  was able to detect differences between what have since been known as scratch and  graze marks. The present study expands from this, developing a more detailed  analysis of these traces. Here, we use advanced data science techniques to  provide a means of understanding trampling mark variations, contributing to our  knowledge of site formation processes. Our results show how scratch and graze  marks are a product of progressional decay and changes in cortical hardness,  providing a new means of understanding taphonomic processes. LAY DESCRIPTION: The  study of microscopic bone surface modifications in archaeology and palaeontology  is of great importance, allowing for a detailed reconstruction of the formation  of a site and providing a means of interpreting the fossil register. The damage  that sedimentary abrasion can produce, however, is likely to distort and  influence these studies, thus requiring a detailed understanding of the different  traces that can be found on different materials. Here, we use advanced 3D digital  microscopy and pattern recognition algorithms to analyse the different marks  produced in different sedimentological contexts, also controlling for other  variables such as the state of the bone when buried, the type of bone and the  time exposed to these types of damages. Through this detailed microscopic  analysis of these types of damages, we are able to conclude that morphological  variations in trampling marks are product of the state of decay when the bones  are buried.";jmi.12873.txt

The paucity of existing data relevant to  changes in written language in the presence of acute mania suggests that lexical,  syntactic and stylometric descriptions of written discourse produced by a cohort  of patients with a diagnosis of acute mania will be necessary to support the  diagnosis independently and to look for other periods of mental illness of the  course of the King's life, and in other historically significant figures with  similarly large archives of handwritten documents.";Rentoumi et al. - 2017 - The acute mania of King George III A computationa.txt

This is achieved by  evaluating sexual dimorphism of commonly used and new skeletal elements via uni-  and multi-variate metric trait analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two  skeletal traits were evaluated in 86 individuals from the William M. Bass donated  cremated collection of known sex and age-at-death. Four different predictive  models, logistic regression, random forest, neural network, and calculation of  population specific cut-off points, were used to determine the classification  accuracy (CA) of each feature and several combinations thereof. RESULTS: An  overall CA of ? 80% was obtained for 12 out of 22 features (humerus trochlea  max., and lunate length, humerus head vertical diameter, humerus head transverse  diameter, radius head max., femur head vertical diameter, patella width, patella  thickness, and talus trochlea length) using univariate analysis. Multivariate  analysis showed an increase of CA (? 95%) for certain combinations and models  (e.g., humerus trochlea max. and patella thickness). Our study shows metric  sexual dimorphism to be well preserved in calcined human remains, despite the  changes that occur during burning. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the  potential of machine learning approaches, such as neural networks, for  multivariate analyses. Using these statistical methods improves the rate of  correct sex estimations in calcined human remains and can be applied to highly  fragmented unburnt individuals from both archaeological and forensic contexts.;ajpa.24270.txt

The inquiry is based on new methods for image  processing and document analysis, as well as machine learning algorithms. These  techniques enable identification of the minimal number of authors in a given  group of inscriptions. Our algorithmic analysis, complemented by the textual  information, reveals a minimum of six authors within the examined inscriptions.  The results indicate that in this remote fort literacy had spread throughout the  military hierarchy, down to the quartermaster and probably even below that rank.  This implies that an educational infrastructure that could support the  composition of literary texts in Judah already existed before the destruction of  the first Temple.

Genetics;Skeletal remains are commonly subjected to various analyses, including DNA. As the remains are exposed to taphonomic processes after the death of the organism,  their physicochemical structure undergoes alterations. The success and integrity  of a DNA analysis is thus conditioned by the preservation state of the sample. In  this study, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with further data exploration was employed to  characterize the physicochemical structure of the samples and its correlation  with the preservation state of the DNA. The aim was to test the hypothesis that  ATR-FTIR-obtained spectra contain enough information to allow classification of  the samples based on the preservation of the DNA in the remains. In the study,  138 human bones and teeth originating from the 16th century BC to the 21?st  century AD were used. The samples were cleaned and powdered following the  established methodological procedures for DNA extraction. DNA was extracted and  quantified. The samples were separated into four categories based on the amount  of quantified DNA. The remaining powder was analyzed with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy  and the spectra obtained were explored to extract physicochemical information.  Before the exploration of the acquired data, samples were divided into groups A  (n?=?107) and B (n?=?31). Statistical analyses and machine learning were  performed on the group A samples. The protocol was then validated on the group B  samples, which served to make predictions on the preservation of the DNA in the  remains.

We developed a pre-screening protocol  based on attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier-transform infrared  spectroscopy (FTIR) for assessing the chemical composition and mineralogy of  ancient bone samples. METHODS: ATR-FTIR measurements were performed on bulk bones  of diverse origin and age before collagen extraction. The percentage nitrogen of  bulk bones, as well as the weight percentage, and the percentage carbon and  nitrogen of extracted organic matter were noted. Several machine learning  algorithms were applied to the spectral data and compared for their efficacy in  screening for well preserved collagen. RESULTS: The results showed that (a) the  first derivative of the spectral data was better suited to screening than the raw  FTIR data, especially for a wider spectral range and (b) certain classification  algorithms [e.g. gradient boosting machine (GBM)] were able to efficiently  predict the degree of preservation in bone samples. CONCLUSIONS: This  pre-screening protocol can serve as a fast, concise and inexpensive pre-screening  tool for determining relative degrees of preservation before collagen extraction  and subsequent (14) C dating. The screening power based on the machine learning  techniques can be further improved by accumulating the FTIR spectral data of  bones.;rcm.8720.txt

Therefore, it is beneficial to consider  alternative methods to assess age at death in adult skeletons. The decrease in  bone mineral density with age was explored to generate a method to assess age at  death in human remains. A connectionist computational approach, artificial neural  networks, was employed to model femur densitometry data gathered in 100 female  individuals from the Coimbra Identified Skeletal Collection. Bone mineral density  declines consistently with age and the method performs appropriately, with mean  absolute differences between known and predicted age ranging from 9.19 to 13.49  years. The proposed method-DXAGE-was implemented online to streamline age  estimation.

Due to its cloud free capability,  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an ideal source of information on forest  dynamics in countries with near-constant cloud-cover. However, few studies have  investigated the use of SAR for forest cover estimation in landscapes with highly  sparse and fragmented forest cover. In this study, the potential use of L-band  SAR for forest cover estimation in two regions (Longford and Sligo) in Ireland is  investigated and compared to forest cover estimates derived from three national  (Forestry2010, Prime2, National Forest Inventory), one pan-European (Forest Map  2006) and one global forest cover (Global Forest Change) product. Two  machine-learning approaches (Random Forests and Extremely Randomised Trees) are  evaluated. Both Random Forests and Extremely Randomised Trees classification  accuracies were high (98.1-98.5%), with differences between the two classifiers  being minimal (<0.5%). Increasing levels of post classification filtering led to  a decrease in estimated forest area and an increase in overall accuracy of  SAR-derived forest cover maps. All forest cover products were evaluated using an  independent validation dataset. For the Longford region, the highest overall  accuracy was recorded with the Forestry2010 dataset (97.42%) whereas in Sligo,  highest overall accuracy was obtained for the Prime2 dataset (97.43%), although  accuracies of SAR-derived forest maps were comparable. Our findings indicate that  spaceborne radar could aid inventories in regions with low levels of forest cover  in fragmented landscapes. The reduced accuracies observed for the global and  pan-continental forest cover maps in comparison to national and SAR-derived  forest maps indicate that caution should be exercised when applying these  datasets for national reporting.;Devaney et al. - 2015 - Forest Cover Estimation in Ireland Using Radar Rem.txt

The study of ancient celadon is of great significance for understanding the cultural exchange, of which the classification of ancient celadon is an important part. The goal of this work was to establish a reliable celadon classification model based on EDXRF, machine learning algorithm and Mahalanobis distance. The data set for training machine learning models is constructed of 12 components in the ceramic body and glaze, which are measured by EDXRF. Comparing the predicted results of four machine learning models, the Random forest algorithm performed best on all evaluation indicators. Therefore, the Random forest was the most suitable algorithm for celadon classification with an average accuracy of 96.41% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.985. The contents of the chemical compositions of the sample were determined to be within the corresponding composition ranges of the predicted category. The chemical compositions with greater influence in identifying the categories of ancient ceramics in Random forest were chosen as the characteristic parameters. The general rules of the Mahalanobis distance from the sample to the category center were summarized and used to describe the similarity between the sample and the predicted category. The celadon classification model established by combining these two methods can make a more specific and accurate prediction. The celadon classification model was also adopted to predict the categories of samples excavated from the Jizhou kiln and Chuzhou site. The excellent prediction capability of the model was verified by comparing results with the corresponding background information of samples.;j.ceramint.2019.12.037.txt

From the perspective of human geography, this mountain range provides ready access to highly diverse altitudinally arranged ecosystems. The combination of a geologically and ecologically diverse landscape provides an exceptional context to explore the potential of strontium isotopes to track the movements of people and the conveyance of material culture. Here we develop an isotopic landscape of bioavailable strontium (87Sr/86Sr) that is applied to reconstruct human paleogeography across time in the southern Andes of Argentina and Chile (31 degrees-34 degrees S). These results come from a macro-regional sampling of rodents (N = 65) and plants (N = 26) from modern and archeological contexts. This \Southern Andean Strontium Transect\"" extends over 350 km across the Andes, encompassing the main geological provinces between the Pacific coast (Chile) and the eastern lowlands (Argentina). We follow a recently developed approach to isoscape construction based on Random Forest regression and GIS analysis. Our results suggest that bioavailable strontium is tightly linked with bedrock geology and offers a highly resolved proxy to track human paleogeography involving the levels of territories or daily mobility and anomalous events that disrupt home ranges, such as migration. The southern Andes provide an ideal geological setting to develop this approach, since the geological variation in rock age and composition produces distinctive isotopic signatures for each main biogeographical region. Finally, we apply this framework to a set of results from human remains from the Uspallata Valley in Mendoza (Argentina), to assess the incidence of migration in the key period of the consolidation of agropastoral economies between AD 800 and 1400. The application of the isoscape to the values from human remains confirms the persistence of human groups with relatively restricted territories encompassing Uspallata and the adjacent Precordillera between AD 800 and 1500. We also identify a pulse of human migration between AD 1280 and 1420, shortly preceding the Inka conquest.

To design software meeting the needs of the customer and the stakeholders, the intentions, feedback and reviews are to be understood accurately and without ambiguity. These textual inputs often contain inaccuracies, contradictions and are seldom given in a well-structured form. The issues mentioned in the previous thought frequently result in the program not satisfying the expectation of the stakeholders. In particular, for non-functional requirements, clients rarely emphasize these specifications as much as they might be justified. Identifying, classifying and reconciling the requirements is one of the main duty of the System Analyst, which without using a proper tool, can be very demanding and time-consuming.

Ancient hunter-gatherers 200,000years ago, with bodies and brains like our own, in bands of a hundred well-known individuals or less, depended on spontaneous cooperative practice of knowledge and skills in a natural world. Before creating language, they appreciated beautiful objects and music. Anthropologists observe that similar living cultures accept that children learn in playful intent participation'. Large modern industrial states with millions of citizens competing in a global economy aim to instruct young people in scientific concepts and the rules of literacy and numeracy deemed important for employment with elaborate machines. Our psychobiological theories commonly assume that an infant starts with a body needing care and emotional regulation and a mind that assimilates concepts of objects by sensorimotor action and requires school instruction in rational principles after several years of cognitive development. Evidence from archeology and evolutionary anthropology indicates that Homo sapiens are born with an imaginative and convivial brain ready for the pleasure of shared invention and with a natural sense of beauty in handmade objects and music. In short, there are innate predispositions for culture for practicing meaningful habits and artful performances that are playfully inventive and seductive for companionship in traditions, and soon capable of grasping the clever purpose of shared tasks and tools.

The complexity of these ancient and historical materials, which are chemically heterogeneous, the product of alteration processes, and inherently not reproducible, is a major obstacle to a thorough understanding of their making and long-term behavior (e.g., fossilization). These challenges required the development of methodologies and instruments coupling imaging and data processing approaches that are optimized for the specific properties of the materials. This Account discusses how these characteristics not only constrain their study but also open up specific innovative avenues for providing key historical information. Synchrotron methods have extensively been used since the late 1990s to study heritage objects, in particular for their potential to provide speciation information from excitation spectroscopies and to image complex heritage objects and samples in two and three dimensions at high resolution. We examine in practice how the identification of key intrinsic chemical specificities has offered fertile ground for the development of novel synchrotron approaches allowing a better stochastic description of the properties of ancient and historical materials. These developments encompass three main aspects: (1) The multiscale heterogeneity of these materials can provide an essential source of information in the development of probes targeting their multiple scales of homogeneity. (2) Chemical alteration can be described in many ways, e.g., by segmenting datasets in a semiquantitative way to jointly inform morphological and chemical transformation pathways. (3) The intrinsic individuality of chemical signatures in artifacts triggers the development of specific strategies, such as those focusing on weak signal detection. We propose a rereading of the advent of these new methodologies for analysis and characterization and examine how they have led to innovative strategies combining materials science, instrument development, history, and data science. In particular, we show that spectral imaging and the search for correlations in image datasets have provided a powerful way to address what archeologists have called the uncertainty and ambiguity of the material record. This approach has implications beyond synchrotron techniques and extends in particular to a series of rapidly developing approaches that couple spectral and spatial information, as in hyperspectral imaging and spatially resolved mass spectrometry. The preeminence of correlations holds promise for the future development of machine learning methods for processing data on historical objects. Beyond heritage, these developments are an original source of inspiration for the study of materials in many related fields, such as environmental, geochemical, or life sciences, which deal with systems whose alteration and heterogeneity cannot be neglected.;Bertrand et al. - 2021 - Deciphering the Chemistry of Cultural Heritage Ta.txt

We motivate our methodological choices in the light of current trends in archaeological prospection, remote sensing, machine learning, and citizen science, and present the first results of the implementation of the workflow in our research area.;rs11070794.txt
KMFEQIQ2;journalArticle;2016;"Czibula, G; Ionescu, VS; Miholca, DL; Mircea, IG";Machine learning-based approaches for predicting stature from archaeological skeletal remains using long bone lengths;JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE;This paper approaches, from a computational perspective, the problem of predicting the stature of human skeletal remains from bone measurements. There are traditional methods for constructing models that give good results for stature estimation. In this paper, we aim to investigate the usefulness of using machine learning-based models to approximate stature. Assuming that the stature of an individual is indirectly related to bone measurement values, we can derive methods that learn from archaeological data and construct models that give good estimates of the stature. Two novel machine learning-based regression models for stature estimation are proposed in this paper. Experiments using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms were performed on samples from the Terry Collection Postcranial Osteometric Database, and the obtained results are discussed and compared with the results from other similar studies. The experimental evaluations indicate that the machine learning-based regression models are efficient for the stature estimation of archaeological remains and highlight the potential of our proposal.

However, due to the costs and efforts required for ancient biomolecular analysis, there has been considerable research into development of accurate and efficient screening approaches for archaeological remains. FTIR spectroscopy is one such approach that has been considered for screening of proteins, but its widespread use has been hindered by the fact that its predictive accuracy can vary widely depending on the extent of sample preservation and the instrument used. Further, screening methods for ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis are scarce. Here we present a new approach to vastly improve upon FTIR-based screening methods prior to ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) and aDNA analysis through the use of random forest-based machine learning. To do so, we use ATR-FTIR to examine three sets of archaeological bone assemblages and analyse them by ZooMS (for taxonomic identification). Two of these are from Palaeolithic contexts, dominated by terrestrial fauna and include specimens with a variety of preservational conditions. The third set consists of Holocene faunal remains, with variable levels of preservation and is dominated by cetaceans. Using the Holocene faunal remains, we were able to more consistently evaluate ATR-FTIR-based screening for mtDNA as well as ZooMS success. We report on the potential of machine learning in ATR-FTIR-based screening for ancient mtDNA analysis, and our machine learning models conclusively improve the accuracy prior to usage of ATR-FTIR-based screening for ZooMS by 20?40%. The results also suggest this approach potentially allows for a universal screening system, applicable across multiple sites and largely independent of the spectrometers used.;j.jas.2020.105311.txt

As the conditions for detecting the sex of a skeleton are not entirely known, machine learning based data mining models are appropriate to address this problem since they are able to capture unobservable patterns in data. These patterns could be relevant for classifying a skeletal remain as male or female. We propose two machine learning models based on artificial neural networks for identifying the sex of human skeletons from bone measurements. The proposed models are experimentally evaluated on case studies generated from two data sets publicly available in the archaeological literature. The obtained results show that the proposed data mining models are effective for detecting the sex of archaeological remains, confirming the potential of our proposal.;miholca_2016.txt

The utility of this deep learning algorithm is presented through an example from the central Mesa Verde region in the northern US Southwest.

The question remains how much of this actively improves on the underlying algorithm versus using it within a 'black box' setting. We survey across ML and CH literature to identify the theoretical changes which contribute to the algorithm and in turn them suitable for CH applications. Alternatively, and most commonly, when there are no changes, we review the CH applications, features and pre/post-processing which make the algorithm suitable for its use. We analyse the dominant divides within ML, Supervised, Semi-supervised and Unsupervised, and reflect on a variety of algorithms that have been extensively used. From such an analysis, we give a critical look at the use of ML in CH and consider why CH has only limited adoption of ML. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.;j.patrec.2020.02.017.txt

By examining an area at discrete temporal periods, archaeologists are literally able to look backwards in time: they can analyse incomplete material records in order to understand and reconstruct the cultural history of an area at particular moments in time. Since the digging process destroys the site forever, great care must be paid during both the excavation and the documentation. In general, after a stratum has been completely excavated, both the floors and walls are cleaned and made ready for documentation. Photos of both the sides and bedrock of a given excavation are collected, and several sketches of what the archaeologists have seen in the trenches are made. In these drawings are delineated the features and shapes of artefacts on the horizontal plane. In addition, depending on the colours and similarities of the textures, drawing are also made of the archaeological layers. This approach is time-consuming, is affected by human ability, and does not make possible a prompt digitization of the results. Within this context, the automatized identification of archaeological stratigraphy during excavation work is welcomed by archaeologists. Here, a k-means unsupervised machine learning algorithm has been used for colour clustering digital images of excavation sites. The algorithm that we have developed attempts to enhance the colour similarity while keeping the colours separate one from another as much as possible. The main idea is that pixels belonging to the same colour cluster are a part of the same layer. Once the layer has been identified, a statistical approach based on Haralick features is used to characterize each strata in terms of texture. Unsupervised machine learning combined with texture analysis could become a good practice in speeding up the documentation work of archaeologists and paving the way towards the creation of an \automated archaeologist\"".""";1757-899X%252F364%252F1%252F012042.txt

Such facilities are rare in Egypt and modern dating techniques which are indispensable in Geoarchaeology to establish a robust chronology are not available, as sample transport is restricted and Egypt does not provide OSL or AMS C-14 laboratories. With these preconditions, we evaluate the usability of pXRF geochemical data for the dating of archaeological sediments with machine learning techniques. The sample material was collected via sampling of archaeological sections and profile walls from archaeological excavations in the northwestern Nile delta at the settlement site Buto (Tell el-Fara'in) and Kom el-Gir. Additionally, samples were taken from sediments and cultural layers uncovered from their surroundings using vibracore corings with open steel auger heads. In this methodological approach, we examine the applicability of pXRF methods and test the sample data for distinct geochemical differences between the main settlement phases with multivariate statistical methods. The dating is based on the training of artificial neural networks with pXRF data from archaeological material of well-dated context to date test data of cultural layers within the vibracores. This allows us to link fundamental changes in the landscape with the settlement history of Buto and neighboring tells.;j.palaeo.2020.109666.txt

The present work tests a recently published method, based on the use of machine learning algorithms for analysing the processes involved in bone breakage, to identify the agent that broke the bones of medium-sized animals at the Mousterian Navalmaillo Rock Shelter (Pinilla del Valle, Madrid). This is the first time this method has been used in an archaeological setting. The results show that these bones were mostly broken by anthropic action, while some were slightly ravaged by carnivores, probably hyaenas. These findings agree very well with published interpretations of the site, and show the method used to be useful in taphonomic studies of archaeological materials with poorly preserved cortical surfaces.;Moclan et al. - 2020 - Identifying the bone-breaker at the Navalmaillo Ro.txt

Various types of environment monitoring data have been accumulated waiting to be analyzed for the aim of future protection. In this paper, a non-stationary data processing strategy is proposed for the better understanding of such monitoring data. The kernel-based extreme learning machine (ELM) is utilized to preprocess the original data and restore the missing parts. Then a new non-uniform sampling time-frequency representation (TFR) is proposed to analyze the non-stationary characteristic of restored data from a signal processing perspective. The test data is the real environment monitoring data of the burial pit at the Yang Mausoleum of the Han dynasty. The experimental result shows that the proposed scheme can extract different information from the original data.;Qi_2017.txt

These tiny artifacts tend to become embedded in the locations where they were first deposited and are less vulnerable to post-depositional movement, making microdebitage an important artifact class for identifying primary areas of stone tool production. Traditional microdebitage analysis, however, can take multiple hours spread over several days to complete. Because of this, microdebitage analysis is typically completed in very small areas of sites due to the intensive time and labor commitment required. Recently, however, my colleagues and I have developed a novel, interdisciplinary method that combines dynamic image analysis and machine learning to analyze microdebitage taken from soil samples at archaeological sites. Analyses of experimental microdebitage demonstrated that microdebitage could be accurately and efficiently identified within archaeological soil samples using this method. In the present study, we apply these methods to soil samples taken from the Maya Capital of Tamarindito in Guatemala to verify whether these methods remain accurate when applied to archaeological contexts.;Johnson_2022.txt

UAV imagery processed with Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi View Stereo (MVS) techniques can provide a low-cost alternative to established shallow seabed mapping techniques offering as well the important visual information. Nevertheless, water refraction poses significant challenges on depth determination. Till now, this problem has been addressed through customized image-based refraction correction algorithms or by modifying the collinearity equation. In this paper, in order to overcome the water refraction errors, we employ machine learning tools that are able to learn the systematic underestimation of the estimated depths. In the proposed approach, based on known depth observations from bathymetric LiDAR surveys, an SVR model was developed able to estimate more accurately the real depths of point clouds derived from SfM-MVS procedures. Experimental results over two test sites along with the performed quantitative validation indicated the high potential of the developed approach.;Agrafiotis et al. - 2019 - SHALLOW WATER BATHYMETRY MAPPING FROM UAV IMAGERY .txt

This paper examines the largest collection of such artefacts found in the area to-date, the 746 spheres from the prehistoric town of Akrotiri in the island of Thera (Santorini). After the spheres were assessed and traditional statistical analyses were applied, machine learning was employed to further examine clustering of the spheres and to suggest potential interpretations of their manufacture, use and deposition.

Other researchers have argued that multivariate methods can efficiently separate both types of marks. Differentiating both taphonomic agents is crucial for determining the ear-liest evidence of carcass processing by hominins. Here, we use an updated machine learning approach (discarding artificially bootstrapping the original imbalanced samples) to show that microscopic features shaped as categorical variables, corresponding to intrinsic properties of mark structure, can accurately discriminate both types of bone modifications. We also implement new deep-learning methods that objectively achieve the highest accuracy in differentiating cut marks from crocodile tooth scores (99% of testing sets). The present study shows that there are precise ways of differentiating both taphonomic agents, and this invites taphonomists to apply them to controversial paleontological and archaeological specimens.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Drawing on developments in computer vision and machine learning, this has the potential to fundamentally recast the capacity of archaeological prospection to cover large areas and deal with mass data, breaking a dependency on human resource. Without such developments, the potential of the vast amount of archaeological information embedded in large topographic and image-based datasets cannot be realized. The purpose of the case study reported on here is to assess existing developments in a Norwegian study against digital topographic data for the island of Arran, Scotland, examining the transferability of the approach and providing a proof of concept in a Scottish context. For Arran, three monument classes were assessed - prehistoric roundhouses, shieling huts of medieval or post-medieval date, and small clearance cairns. These present different challenges to detection, with preliminary results ranging from a manageable mix of false positives and true identifications to the chaotic. The influence of variable morphology and the occurrence of other, largely natural, objects of confusion in the landscape is discussed, highlighting the potential improvements in automated detection routines offered by adding anthropogenic and natural false positives to additional confusion classes.;arp.1731.txt

In areas where numerous rock art sites exist, much of the rock art is unidentified and therefore remains, unrecorded and unresearched. Manually identifying rock art is time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to automate many processes in rock art research, which can be accomplished by Machine Learning. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can greatly facilitate rock art research in many ways, such as through Object Recognition and Detection, Motif Extraction, Object Reconstruction, Image Knowledge Graphs, and Representations. This article is a reflective work on the future of ML for rock art research. As a proof-of-concept, it presents a machine learning method based on recent advances in deep learning to train a model to identify images with painted rock art (pictograms). The efficacy of the proposed method is shown using data collected from fieldwork in Australia. Furthermore, our proposed method can be used to train models that are specific to the rock art found in different regions. We provide the code and the trained models in the supplementary section.;Jalandoni_2022.txt

Alternatively, taphonomic studies on bone surface modifications and bone breakage patterns, have provided heuristic interpretations of some of the best preserved archaeological record of this period; namely, the Olduvai Bed I sites. The most recent and comprehensive taphonomic study of these sites (Dominguez-Rodrigo et al., 2007a) showed that FLK Zinj was an anthropogenic assemblage in which hominins acquired carcasses via primary access. That study also showed that the other sites were palimpsests with minimal or no intervention by hominins. The FLK N, FLK NN and DK sequence seemed to be dominated by single-agent (mostly, felid) or multiple-agent (mostly, felid-hyenid) processes. The present study re-analyzes the Bed I sites focusing on skeletal part profiles. Machine learning methods, which incorporate complex algorithms, are powerful predictive and classification methods and have the potential to better extract information from skeletal part representation than past approaches. Here, multiple algorithms (via decision trees, neural networks, random forests and support vector machines) are combined to produce a solid interpretation of bone accumulation agency at the Olduvai Bed I sites. This new approach virtually coincides with previous taphonomic interpretations on a site by site basis and shows that felids were dominant accumulating agents over hyenas during Bed I times. The recent discovery of possibly a modern lion-accumulated assemblage at Olduvai Gorge (Arriaza et al., submitted) provides a very timely analog for this interpretation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Optimization of the blocking strategy was able to improve application run-time per record by 20%. After record-match alpha-level optimization, the application was found to link 89.6% of the record out-group to DPAA master data at an accuracy of 99.6%.

Our descriptor is based on a multi-view approach of curvature features, consisting of the following steps: pose normalization of 3D models, local curvature descriptor calculation, construction of 3D shape descriptor using the multi-view approach and curvature maps, and dimensionality reduction by random projections. We generate two descriptors from two different paradigms: 1) handcrafted, wherein the descriptor is manually designed for object feature extraction, and directly passed on to the classifier and 2) machine learnt, in which the descriptor automatically learns the object features through a pretrained deep neural network model (VGG-16) for transfer learning and passed on to the classifier. These descriptors are applied to two different archaeological datasets: 1) non-public Mexican dataset, represented by a collection of 963 3D archaeological objects from the Templo Mayor Museum in Mexico City that includes anthropomorphic sculptures, figurines, masks, ceramic vessels, and musical instruments; and 2) 3D pottery content-based retrieval benchmark dataset, consisting of 411 objects. Once the multi-view descriptors are obtained, we evaluate their effectiveness by using the following object classification schemes: K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and structured support vector machine. Our object descriptors classification results are compared against five popular 3D descriptors in the literature, namely, rotation invariant spherical harmonic, histogram of spherical orientations, signature of histograms of orientations, symmetry descriptor, and reflective symmetry descriptor. Experimentally, we were able to verify that our machine learnt and handcrafted descriptors offer the best classification accuracy (20% better on average than comparative descriptors), independently of the classification methods.

At present, their specific manufacture dates and workshop localities are unknown. Relying on subjective, visual methods, scholars have grappled with their classification and regional attribution for over a century. This study combines visual approaches with machine learning techniques to offer data-driven perspectives on the classification and attribution of this Iron Age corpus. The study sample consists of 162 sculptures of female figures that have been conventionally attributed to three main regional carving traditions: \Phoenician,\"" \""North Syrian,\"" and \""Syrian/South Syrian\"". We have developed an algorithm that clusters the ivories based on a combination of descriptive and anthropometric data. The resulting categories, which are based on purely statistical criteria, show good agreement with conventional art historical classifications, while revealing new insights, especially with regard to the \""Syrian/South Syrian\"" tradition. Specifically, we have determined that objects of the Syrian/South Syrian tradition might be more closely related to Phoenician objects than to North Syrian objects. We also reconsider the classification of a subset of \""Phoenician\"" objects, and we confirm Syrian/South Syrian stylistic subgroups, the geographic distribution of which might illuminate Neo-Assyrian acquisition networks. Additionally, we have identified the features in our cluster assignments that might be diagnostic of regional traditions. In short, our study both corroborates traditional visual classifications and demonstrates how machine learning techniques may be employed to retrieve complementary information not accessible through an exclusively visual analysis.

QEGCRMRP;journalArticle;2020;"Lopez-Garcia, PA; Argote, DL; Thrun, MC";Projection-Based Classification of Chemical Groups for Provenance Analysis of Archaeological Materials;IEEE ACCESS;In provenance analysis, identifying the origin of the archaeological artifacts plays a significant role. Usually, this problem is addressed by discovering natural groups in data measured with spectroscopic techniques. Then, principal component and classical partitioning cluster analysis are employed to reveal the groups that supposedly define the origin of the investigated artefacts. However, this work shows that maximizing the variance and searching for specific cluster structures can be misleading because it fails to discriminate clearly the different archeological sources. In contrast, the new methodology reveals several acknowledged geological sources present in the materials through the exploitation of emergence and swarm intelligence without prior assumptions about the data structures. A combination of unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning and chemometric is applied on samples of Mesoamerican geological sources and obsidian artefacts collected from the archaeological site of Xalasco in Mexico. The analysis of the artifacts showed a preference of Xalasco inhabitants to local obsidian deposits. The results show that this approach, in terms of robustness, is suitable for handling unbiased quantitative spectral analysis of archaeological materials revealing the natural groups of archeological data.;Lopez-Garcia et al. - 2020 - Projection-Based Classification of Chemical Groups.txt
5DPGRLLE;journalArticle;2020;"Martin-Perea, DM; Courtenay, LA; Domingo, MS; Morales, J";Application of artificially intelligent systems for the identification of discrete fossiliferous levels;PEERJ;The separation of discrete fossiliferous levels within an archaeological or paleontological site with no clear stratigraphic horizons has historically been carried out using qualitative approaches, relying on two-dimensional transversal and longitudinal projection planes. Analyses of this type, however, can often be conditioned by subjectivity based on the perspective of the analyst. This study presents a novel use of Machine Learning algorithms for pattern recognition techniques in the automated separation and identification of fossiliferous levels. This approach can be divided into three main steps including: (1) unsupervised Machine Learning for density based clustering (2) expert-in-the-loop Collaborative Intelligence Learning for the integration of geological data followed by (3) supervised learning for the final fine-tuning of fossiliferous level models. For evaluation of these techniques, this method was tested in two Late Miocene sites of the Batallones Butte paleontological complex (Madrid, Spain). Here we show Machine Learning analyses to be a valuable tool for the processing of spatial data in an efficient and quantitative manner, successfully identifying the presence of discrete fossiliferous levels in both Batallones-3 and Batallones-10. Three discrete fossiliferous levels have been identified in Batallones-3, whereas another three have been differentiated in Batallones-10.;Martin-Perea et al. - 2020 - Application of artificially intelligent systems fo.txt

The method is based on graph analysis that iteratively compares and manipulates Hamming distances between graphs of input geographical parameters and graphs of human activity data in various historical periods. The weights learned from the comparison was used to build a prediction model to estimate the potential presence of an archaeological site of a certain time period in a given cadaster. This was applied in the Bohemian Moravian Highlands region based on the most complete archaeological dataset of the area. Resulting maps were analyzed from the archaeological and historical point of view to test against the existing knowledge of prehistoric population movement in the region. Overall, the method proved to overcome problems such as fragmentary inputs and is a good candidate for application in smaller and geographically diverse research areas. The aim of this work was to contribute to the methodology of the prediction of historical human activity, to facilitate greater comprehension of past local settlement dynamics, and to possibly ease the protection of cultural heritage.;Mertel et al. - 2018 - Spatial predictive modeling of prehistoric sites i.txt

Archaeologists use insights from the experimental replication of lithics to understand phenomena such as the behaviours and cognitive capacities required to manufacture them. However, such experiments can require large amounts of time and raw materials, and achieving sufficient control of key variables can be difficult. A computer program able to accurately simulate stone tool production would make lithic experimentation faster, more accessible, reproducible, less biased, and may lead to reliable insights into the factors that structure the archaeological record. We present here a proof of concept for a machine learning-based virtual knapping framework capable of quickly and accurately predicting flake removals from 3D cores using a conditional adversarial neural network (CGAN). We programmatically generated a testing dataset of standardised 3D cores with flakes knapped from them. After training, the CGAN accurately predicted the length, volume, width, and shape of these flake removals using the intact core surface information alone. This demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning for investigating lithic production virtually. With a larger training sample and validation against archaeological data, virtual knapping could enable fast, cheap, and highly-reproducible virtual lithic experimentation.;Figueroa et al. - 2021 - A proof of concept for machine learning-based virt.txt

Looting is also understood to generate revenue, but systematic analysis of this issue is challenged by its opacity: how can we study the economic effects of archaeological looting when the practice is rarely directly observable? To address this problem, we estimate the market value of archaeological sites where artifacts have been previously excavated and documented, using a machine-learning approach. The first step uses 41,587 sales of objects from 33 firms to train an algorithm to predict the distribution channel, lot packaging, and estimated sale price of objects based on their observable characteristics. The second step uses the trained algorithm to estimate the value of sites in which a large number of artifacts have been legally excavated and documented.

This debate, commonly known as the hunter-scavenger debate, fostered the emergence of a new research line into the Bone Surface Modifications (BSMs) produced by both taphonomic agents. Throughout the following 20 years, multiple studies concerning the action of carnivores have been developed, with a particular focus on the oldest archaeological sites in East Africa. Recent technological advances applied to taphonomy have provided new insight into carnivore BSMs. A newly developed part of this work relies on Geometric Morphometrics (GMM) studies aimed at discerning carnivore agency through the morphologic characterization of tooth scores and pits. GMM studies have produced promising results, however methodological limitations are still present. This paper presents the first combined application of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and GMM to the analysis of carnivore tooth marks, generating classification rates of 100% between carnivore species in some cases.;j.palaeo.2019.03.007.txt

In some cases, classification may reach an accuracy of 100%. No other statistical tool commonly used in taphonomy had been this successful at classification before. However, the heuristics of ML algorithms depend tightly on the objectivity in raw data collection. The use of multivariate approaches in which variables are independently scored by the analyst introduces a subjective bias. In this work, I show that different analysts producing raw data on the same testing data set can lead to widely divergent BSM classifications and interpretations using the same powerful ML algorithms. It is emphasized that until an objective non-biasing method of raw data collection is implemented, BSM classification carried out via statistical tests will remain heuristically limited. As a consequence, the application of these referents to archeological BSM does not guarantee a correct interpretation beyond the analyst expertise.;s12520-018-0684-9.txt
H9TLAY5U;journalArticle;2020;"Daumantas, L; Balakauskas, L; Spiridonov, A";Machine learning reveals the role of the landscape in the dynamics of human settlement rules between the Palaeolithic and Iron Ages in Lithuania;QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL;Settlement distribution modelling assumes that human spatial behaviour can be revealed by using the correct set of variables. However, the regional variables of large-scale gradients are only considered rarely. Also, settlement modelling applications are often impeded by fragmentary and error-prone datasets. Thus, in current-day Lithuania, in order to study the dynamics of settlement distributional rules, we implemented a modelling strategy that involves the use of statistical and machine learning methods with null model simulations and that is less affected by the incompleteness of datasets and the scales of variables. In this study, we used regional variables in order to test their usefulness while providing a general understanding of the large-scale processes that governed settlement distribution in prehistory. This study encompassed six time intervals between the Palaeolithic and Iron Ages. The obtained results consisted of regional settlement predictive maps, estimations of random forest variable importance and performances of GAM models, as well as determinations of Besag's L-functions of settlement patterns and Euclidean distances between the regional variables at the settlement sites. We detected decreasing spatial autocorrelation of the settlement prediction maps and settlement patterns, declining variable importance and model performance, as well as increasing regional environmental diversity of the settlement sites. A marked manifestation of these trends was observed between the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. This also corresponded to a major change in the constitution of the most important variables of the settlement distributions. We associate these findings with technological and lifestyle changes in the southern Baltic region, interpreting them as causing a roughening of the human adaptive landscape increasing the specificity, number and complexity of the settlement distributional rules. Our study revealed that, even for incomplete datasets and spatial autocorrelation, the application of advanced statistical/machine learning techniques was able to provide new insights into the processes that governed the socio-cultural evolution and spatial dynamics of humans in prehistory.;j.quaint.2020.09.004.txt

Due to restrictions on exporting geological samples from Egypt, modern geoscientific studies in the Nile Delta lack the possibility of dating the investigated sediments and geological features by standard techniques such as OSL or AMS C-14; therefore, this study aims to validate a new approach using machine-learning algorithms on portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) data. Archaeologically dated sediments from the archaeological excavations of Buto (Tell el-Fara'in; on-site) that pXRF analyses have geochemically characterized serve as training data for running and comparing Neural Nets, Random Forests, and single-decision trees. The established pXRF fingerprints are transferred via machine-learning algorithms to set up a chronology for undated sediments from sediment cores (i.e., the test data) of the nearby surroundings (off-site). Neural Nets and Random Forests work fine in dating sediments and deliver the best classification results compared with single-decision trees, which struggle with outliers and tend to overfit the training data. Furthermore, Random Forests can be modeled faster and are easier to understand than the complex, less transparent Neural Nets. Therefore, Random Forests provide the best algorithm for studies like this. Furthermore, river features east of Kom el-Gir are dated to pre-Ptolemaic times (before 332 B.C.) when Kom el-Gir had possibly not yet been settled. The research in this paper shows the success of close interactions from various scientific disciplines (Geoinformatics, Physical Geography, Archaeology, Ancient History) to decipher landscape evolution in the long-term-settled Nile Delta's environs using machine learning. With the approach's design and the possibility of integrating many other geographical/sedimentological methods, this study demonstrates the potential of the methodological approach to be applied in other geoscientific fields.";Seeliger-Comparing different machine-learning.txt

DXLJQF8G;journalArticle;2018;MacLeod, N;The quantitative assessment of archaeological artifact groups: Beyond geometric morphometrics;QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS;Archaeologists often wish to distinguish between groups of cultural artifacts using information collected from descriptions or measurements of their morphological forms. Morphometric methods have played an increasingly large role in such quantitative assessments. However, standard approaches to morphometric analyses are often poorly suited to many artifact types as much variation of interest to archeologists cannot be quantified adequately by sparse sets of landmarks or semilandmarks. Use of measurement conventions also requires that investigators know which aspects of the artifacts under consideration are important to include at the outset of an investigation. In this review results obtained from landmark-semilandmark-based, and image pixel-based assessments of a common set of Paleoindian fluted projectile points are compared. Results confirm that, by itself, PCA is unsuited for the assessment of between-group differences irrespective of data type, but can be useful as a transformation to reduce the dimensionality of a morphological dataset while retaining its effective information content. Landmark-semilandmark data analysed using geometric morphometric methods delivered the lowest-quality results whereas image pixel data analysed by the Naive Bayes machine-learning classifier delivered the highest. Direct analyses of artifact images using geometric morphometric methods delivered very good results. These findings suggest that the direct analyses of digital images and 3D scans, using either geometric morphometric data-analysis methods or machine-learning procedures, can provide archaeologists with tools that improve and extend the scope of their assessments of a wide range of artifact types.

These deposits provide important insights into Native American socioeconomic organization but are also quite rare: only about 50 such rings have been documented to date. Recent work using automated LiDAR analysis demonstrates that many more shell rings likely exist than are currently recorded in state archaeological databases. Here, we use deep learning, a form of machine intelligence, to detect shell ring deposits and identify their geographic range in LiDAR data from South Carolina. We corroborate our results using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), multispectral data, and a random forest analysis. We conclude that a greater number of shell rings exist and that their distribution expanded further north than currently documented. Our evidence suggests that ring-construction was a more widespread and common practice during the mid-Holocene.;j.jas.2021.105433.txt

A2QXBKFI;journalArticle;2018;"Gu, MX; Buckley, M";Semi-supervised machine learning for automated species identification by collagen peptide mass fingerprinting;BMC BIOINFORMATICS;Background: Biomolecular methods for species identification are increasingly being utilised in the study of changing environments, both at the microscopic and macroscopic levels. High-throughput peptide mass fingerprinting has been largely applied to bacterial identification, but increasingly used to identify archaeological and palaeontological skeletal material to yield information on past environments and human-animal interaction. However, as applications move away from predominantly domesticate and the more abundant wild fauna to a much wider range of less common taxa that do not yet have genetically-derived sequence information, robust methods of species identification and biomarker selection need to be determined. Results: Here we developed a supervised machine learning algorithm for classifying the species of ancient remains based on collagen fingerprinting. The aim was to minimise requirements on prior knowledge of known species while yielding satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. The algorithm uses iterations of a modified random forest classifier with a similarity scoring system to expand its identified samples. We tested it on a set of 6805 spectra and found that a high level of accuracy can be achieved with a training set of five identified specimens per taxon. Conclusions: This method consistently achieves higher accuracy than two-dimensional principal component analysis and similar accuracy with hierarchical clustering using optimised parameters, which greatly reduces requirements for human input. Within the vertebrata, we demonstrate that this method was able to achieve the taxonomic resolution of family or sub-family level whereas the genus- or species-level identification may require manual interpretation or further experiments. In addition, it also identifies additional species biomarkers than those previously published.;Gu et Buckley - 2018 - Semi-supervised machine learning for automated spe.txt

A total of 48 fragments have been discovered in three locations; Bolgar, the Moscow Kremlin (MosKremlin), and Selitrennoe settlement (Selitrennoe). The assemblages were subjected to INAA in order to determine the concentrations of 37 elements in mg/kg. The data were analyzed using geochemical, bivariate, and multivariate statistical techniques. To classify the fragments according to their origin hierarchical clustering (HCA), linear discriminant (LDA), and principal component analyses (PCA) were used. Based on the INAA results, the first attempt was made to apply machine learning methods to the study of artifacts in Russia. The results show that they are reliable and powerful in extracting information about critical elements for identifying ceramic fragments and using them as chemical fingerprints. Chromium was the most useful element and was used in conjunction with other elements as a fingerprint to distinguish sherds.

This most crucial part of taphonomic analysis of the archaeological human record has been controversial due to highly subjective interpretations of BSM. Here, we use a sample of 79 trampling and cut marks to compare the accuracy in mark identification on bones by human experts and computer trained algorithms. We demonstrate that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and support vector machines (SVM) can recognize marks with accuracy that far exceeds that of human experts. Automated recognition and analysis of BSM using DCNN can achieve an accuracy of 91% of correct identification of cut and trampling marks versus a much lower accuracy rate (63%) obtained by trained human experts. This success underscores the capability of machine learning algorithms to help resolve controversies in taphonomic research and, more specifically, in the study of bone surface modifications. We envision that the proposed methods can help resolve on-going controversies on the earliest human meat-eating behaviors in Africa and other issues such as the earliest occupation of America.

Species identification is hindered because of the few taxonomically informative structures available, making the task laborious and genus definition controversial. Thus, its taxonomy is one of the most complex among Nematoda. Eggs are the parasitic structures most viewed in coprological analysis in both modern and ancient samples; consequently, their presence is indicative of positive diagnosis for infection. The structure of the egg could play a role in genera or species discrimination. Institutional biological collections are taxonomic repositories of specimens described and strictly identified by systematics specialists.MethodsThe present work aims to characterize eggs of capillariid species deposited in institutional helminth collections and to process the morphological, morphometric and ecological data using machine learning (ML) as a new approach for taxonomic identification. Specimens of 28 species and 8 genera deposited at ColecAo Helmintologica do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (CHIOC, IOC/FIOCRUZ/Brazil) and Collection de Nematodes Zooparasites du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris (MNHN/France) were examined under light microscopy. In the morphological and morphometric analyses (MM), the total length and width of eggs as well as plugs and shell thickness were considered. In addition, eggshell ornamentations and ecological parameters of the geographical location (GL) and host (H) were included.ResultsThe performance of the logistic model tree (LMT) algorithm showed the highest values in all metrics compared with the other algorithms.

This traditional approach has been challenged, however, by the current new practices in archaeological studies, which tend to rely on more scientific methods (e.g. information systems) to understand the wider context of the socio-cultural aspects of past societies. For example, the Nabataean studies, which for more than seventeen decades after the rediscovery of Petra in 1812, are based on the art historical analysis of the rock-cut facades of the the city of Petra. The wider story of the socio-cultural, political, and economic aspects of the Nabataean culture is still not well understood. Just recently archaeological research was undertaken to improve the understanding of the Nabaatean phenomenon from outside Petra. This paper discusses this new attempt to investigate the spatial organization and land use of Wadi Musa during the Nabataean period based on GIS analysis and new archaeological discoveries. Utilizing GIS in discovering historical phenomena provides a new perspective for analysis, whereby structures are treated not as individual archaeological items but rather as a system. This paper also presents a case study that demonstrates the significance of using GIS for historical research by shedding light on the temporal variation of Wadi Musa settlements with special focus on the paleo-landuse of the Nabatean period. The resulting reconstructed map indicates that Wadi Musa was well planned with special zones for elite residents, industry, rural communities, and agriculture. Social segregation/stratification is also well indicated in the plan of the city. The reconstructed map indicates that the strategy for Nabataean land use for Wadi Musa was to use it as a green zone around the city of Gaia.;Farajat_2021.txt

A perspective from bone diagenesis at El Mirador cave (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain);JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE;Long and complex sequences of intentional organic rich sediments accumulation known as fumiers can often be found in many caves and rock shelters used for herding activities since the Neolithic to current times in the Mediterranean basin. These are mainly composed of burnt animal dung and vegetal remains and are commonly interpreted as the result of livestock domestic occupations and stabling activities. The repetitive and systematic burning processes that occurred for cleaning these spaces provide different layers with different archaeosedimentary features (facies). Fumier facies imply different pre-burial conditions that may influence bone diagenetic processes. In this work, we study the changes occurring in mineral and organic components of bones included in different facies (reelaborated, burned, unburned) in El Mirador cave fumier using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). We have carried out an analysis of 47 bone remains from four different facies [a, r(m), tf and v] from archaeological levels dated from the second half of the 5th until the first half of the 2nd millennia cal B.C. We have used a total of 13 parameters through ATR-FTIR to discriminate facies differences through PCA and Machine Learning techniques. The results show differences in crystallinity, organic, and carbonates content between bone remains recovered from fumier facies. Our results demonstrate that burial environments that occur on fumier deposits affect bone components in different ways. Therefore, fumier facies can be differentiated from each other through the diagenetic parameters provided by bone assemblage, distinguishing those well preserved and, therefore, eligible for other types of analyses (isotopes, proteomics, lipids, etc.). Furthermore, Machine Learning can classify the facies through carbonates indices API, C/C, and BPI. This study is an important step towards understanding the taphonomic processes (formation and reelaboration) that occur in fumier sequence as a result of the multiple livestock activities developed in caves and rock shelters.;De_VALLE_2022.txt
UAE6HTLG;journalArticle;2022;Prasomphan, S;Toward Fine-grained Image Retrieval with Adaptive Deep Learning for Cultural Heritage Image;COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING;Fine-grained image classification is a challenging research topic because of the high degree of similarity among categories and the high degree of dissimilarity for a specific category caused by different poses and scales. A cultural heritage image is one of the fine-grained images because each image has the same similarity in most cases. Using the classification technique, distinguishing cultural heritage architecture may be difficult. This study proposes a cultural heritage content retrieval method using adaptive deep learning for fine-grained image retrieval. The key contribution of this research was the creation of a retrieval model that could handle incremental streams of new categories while maintaining its past performance in old categories and not losing the old categorization of a cultural heritage image. The goal of the proposed method is to perform a retrieval task for classes. Incremental learning for new classes was conducted to reduce the re-training process. In this step, the original class is not necessary for re-training which we call an adaptive deep learning technique. Cultural heritage in the case of Thai archaeological site architecture was retrieved through machine learning and image processing. We analyze the experimental results of incremental learning for fine-grained images with images of Thai archaeological site architecture from world heritage provinces in Thailand, which have a similar architecture. Using a fine-grained image retrieval technique for this group of cultural heritage images in a database can solve the problem of a high degree of similarity among categories and a high degree of dissimilarity for a specific category. The proposed method for retrieving the correct image from a database can deliver an average accuracy of 85 percent. Adaptive deep learning for fine-grained image retrieval was used to retrieve cultural heritage content, and it outperformed state-of-theart methods in fine-grained image retrieval.;Prasomphan - 2023 - Toward Fine-grained Image Retrieval with Adaptive .txt

The association of heterogeneous information to 3D data by means of automated segmentation and classification methods can help to characterize, describe and better interpret the object under study. Indeed, the high complexity of 3D data along with the large diversity of heritage assets themselves have constituted segmentation and classification methods as currently active research topics. Although machine learning methods brought great progress in this respect, few advances have been developed in relation to cultural heritage 3D data. Starting from the existing literature, this paper aims to develop, explore and validate reliable and efficient automated procedures for the classification of 3D data (point clouds or polygonal mesh models) of heritage scenarios. In more detail, the proposed solution works on 2D data (texture-based approach) or directly on the 3D data (geometry-based approach) with supervised or unsupervised machine learning strategies. The method was applied and validated on four different archaeological/architectural scenarios.

Dating from the High Middle Ages, these sherds have been engraved with repeated patterns using a carved wooden wheel. The study of these engraved patterns allows archaeologists to better understand the diffusion of ceramic productions. In this paper, we present a method that classifies patterns of ceramic sherds by combining deep learning-based features extracted from some pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. A dataset composed of 888 digital patterns extracted from 3D scans of pottery sherds was used to evaluate our approach. The classification capacity of each CNN model was first assessed individually. Then, several combinations of common pooling methods using different classifiers were tested. The best result was obtained when features of the VGG19 and ResNet50 models were combined using Compact Bilinear Pooling (CBP) with a high classification rate of 95.23%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Through structure from motion (SfM) and multi-view-stereo (MVS) techniques, aerial imagery can provide a low-cost alternative compared to bathymetric LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) surveys, as it offers additional important visual information and higher spatial resolution. Nevertheless, water refraction poses significant challenges on depth determination. Till now, this problem has been addressed through customized image-based refraction correction algorithms or by modifying the collinearity equation. In this article, in order to overcome the water refraction errors in a massive and accurate way, we employ machine learning tools, which are able to learn the systematic underestimation of the estimated depths. In particular, an SVR (support vector regression) model was developed, based on known depth observations from bathymetric LiDAR surveys, which is able to accurately recover bathymetry from point clouds derived from SfM-MVS procedures. Experimental results and validation were based on datasets derived from different test-sites, and demonstrated the high potential of our approach. Moreover, we exploited the fusion of LiDAR and image-based point clouds towards addressing challenges of both modalities in problematic areas.";rs11192225.txt
4KEDNVIC;journalArticle;2021;"Davis, DS; Lundin, J";Locating Charcoal Production Sites in Sweden Using LiDAR, Hydrological Algorithms, and Deep Learning;REMOTE SENSING;Over the past several centuries, the iron industry played a central role in the economy of Sweden and much of northern Europe. A crucial component of iron manufacturing was the production of charcoal, which was often created in charcoal piles. These features are visible in LiDAR (light detection and ranging) datasets. These charcoal piles vary in their morphology by region, and training data for some feature types are severely lacking. Here, we investigate the potential for machine automation to aid archaeologists in recording charcoal piles with limited training data availability in a forested region of Jonkoping County, Sweden. We first use hydrological depression algorithms to conduct a preliminary assessment of the study region and compile suitable training data for charcoal production sites. Then, we use these datasets to train a series of RetinaNet deep learning models, which are less computationally expensive than many popular deep learning architectures (e.g., R-CNNs), allowing for greater usability. Together, our results demonstrate how charcoal piles can be automatically extracted from LiDAR datasets, which has great implications for improving our understanding of the long-term environmental impact of the iron industry across Northern Europe. Furthermore, our workflow for developing and implementing deep learning models for archaeological research can expand the use of such methods to regions that lack suitable training data.;Davis et Lundin - 2021 - Locating Charcoal Production Sites in Sweden Using.txt
ZUYHKAZB;journalArticle;2018;"Perry, GLW; O'Sullivan, D";Identifying Narrative Descriptions in Agent-Based Models Representing Past Human-Environment Interactions;JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL METHOD AND THEORY;There is a growing use of bottom-up simulation models to reconstruct past human-environment interactions. Such detailed representations pose difficult questions not only in their design (the generality-realism trade-off) but also about the inferences that are made from them. The historical sciences are faced with seeking to make robust inferences from limited, potentially biased and/or incomplete samples from uncontrolled systems, and as a result have sometimes employed narrative explanation. By contrast, simulation models can be used experimentally and can generate large amounts of data. Here, using an agent-based model of hunter-gatherer foraging in a previously unexplored ecosystem, we consider how narratives might be identified from the trajectories produced by simulations. We show how machine learning methods can isolate qualitatively similar types of model behaviour based on summaries of model outcomes and time series. We stand to learn from this approach because it enables us to answer two questions: (i) under what conditions (representations and/or parameterisations) do we observe in the model what is recorded in the archaeological and/or palaeoenvironmental record? and (ii) does the model yield unobserved dynamics? If so, are they plausible? Using models to develop narratives is a logical extension of the bottom-up approach inherent in agent-based modelling and has the potential, alongside conventional methods of model evaluation, to aid in learning from the rich dynamics of such simulations.;Perry et O'Sullivan - 2018 - Identifying Narrative Descriptions in Agent-Based .txt

A geometric-morphometric analysis of surface bone modifications of a Paranthropus boisei skeleton;QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL;Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania) is one of the key areas for the study of human origins, given the sheer abundance of archaeological and paleontological sites discovered. Several of these archaeological sites have yielded numerous hominin fossils and traces of their activities, thus offering invaluable insights into the nature and origins of human behavior. Nevertheless, certain taphonomic discussions that have been of great importance for the study of the South African cave sites have remained unnoticed in East Africa. One of these issues revolves around the interpretation of Paranthropus as a common prey of predators. In this paper, we analyze the postcranial remains of OH80, a partial skeleton of a Paranthropus boisei discovered at the BK site (Bell Korongo, Bed II of Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) in 2010. Some of the specimens of this skeleton have been reported to show surface modifications tentatively associated to the action of carnivores. Here, several pits observed on OH80-12, the Paranthropus boisei femur, were digitally reconstructed and analyzed through geometric morphometrics to determine the nature of the marks. The OH80-12 marks are compared with a modern sample of percussion marks and several carnivore tooth pits, since the action of both agents has previously been identified at the site and can sometimes result in equifinality problems. Alongside already published geometric morphometric tests, here we present a very newly developed approach based on the combination of geometric morphometric data and the training of machine learning algorithms. Both methodologies highlight that OH80 was consumed by carnivores, being a felid the most likely modifying agent.;j.quaint.2019.05.029.txt
CPVXAKV8;journalArticle;2021;"Brandsen, A; Lippok, F";A burning question-Using an intelligent grey literature search engine to change our views on early medieval burial practices in the Netherlands;JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE;This paper presents a case study on Early Medieval burial practices using AGNES, an intelligent search engine for Dutch archaeological grey literature. Traditionally, it is assumed that cremations phased out at the start of the Early Middle Ages, when the inhumation practice became more numerous. However, recent research (Lippok, 2020) shows that cremations might be more prevalent than previously assumed. Due to research efforts being concentrated on furnished inhumations, cremations and other types of burials have not received their share of research interest. It is suspected that unknown Early Medieval cremations may be found in grey literature research reports. The rapidly growing document collection requires more efficient methods to search through this big data, as manual searching is too time intensive. AGNES uses machine learning to allow searching on archaeological concepts (such as time periods and artefacts) in full texts, solving common problems with synonymy and polysemy. This paper describes a controlled search for Early Medieval cremations in the Netherlands, and a comparison of the new information uncovered from the reports to prior knowledge on the topic. The queries resulted in 2541 hits. Twenty-three Early Medieval cremations that were previously unknown to experts were uncovered, and 31 (of 77) known sites were identified. Forty-one possibly interesting documents were noted, where it was not clear from the report if Early Medieval cremations were present. 2446 documents were not relevant to the study for various reasons. The 23 new sites are an increase of 30% over the existing knowledge of experts. In the last 20 years only nine new sites featuring Early Medieval cremations were discovered, so being able to add another 23 is a major development. Adding previously unknown Early Medieval cremations to the dataset challenges the existing bias for inhumation graves, and supports striving towards viewing the Early Medieval burial repertoire as more heterogeneous and representative. This indicates that AGNES is useful for archaeological research, and the uncovered information can lead to a more cohesive view of the past.;j.jas.2021.105456.txt

Acquiring representative, high quality data is the most important criterion to assess the value of any spatial analysis, however, there are many situations in which these criteria cannot be fulfilled. Archived data, collected in the past, for which analysis cannot be repeated or supplemented is a very common information source. Archaeological data collected at a regional extent during years of field work and superficial observations are an additional example. Such data rarely provide representative samples and are usually imbalanced; only very few examples contain useful data, while many examples remain without any archaeological traces. In spite of these limitations archaeological information presented in the form of maps can be a useful and helpful tool to analyse the spatial patterns of some phenomena and, from a more practical point of view, a tool to predict the location of undiscovered occurrences. The primary goal of this paper is to present a methodology for modelling spatial patterns based on imbalanced categorical data which do not fulfil the criteria of spatial representation and incorporates uncertainty in its decision process. This concept will be discussed using a collection of Stone Age sites and set of environmental variables from the postglacial lowlands in Western Poland. We will propose a machine-learning system which adopts CART through bootstrap simulation to incorporate uncertainty into the spatial model and utilise that uncertainty in the decision-making process. Finally, we will describe the relationships between the model and environmental variables and present our results in cartographic form using the principles of decision-tree cartography.";Jasiewicz et Sobkowiak-Tabaka - 2015 - Geo-spatial modelling with unbalanced data modell.txt

With a deep learning approach for post-mortem interval estimation (ranging from one day to 2000 years) in bones, the estimation can be approximated with high precision. It is challenging to estimate the post-mortem interval (PMI) of skeletal remains within a forensic context. As a result of their interactions with the environment, bones undergo several chemical and physical changes after death. So far, multiple methods have been used to follow up on post-mortem changes. There is, however, no definitive way to estimate the PMI of skeletal remains. This research aimed to propose a methodology capable of estimating the PMI using micro-computed tomography measurements of 104 human skeletal remains with PMIs between one day and 2000 years. The present study indicates that micro-computed tomography could be considered an objective and precise method of PMI evaluation in forensic medicine. The measured parameters show a significant difference regarding the PMI for Cort Porosity p < 0.001, BV/TV p > 0.001, Mean1 p > 0.001 and Mean2 p > 0.005.

We use an unmanned vehicle and other remote surveillance sensors, coupled with onboard pattern recognition algorithms, to perform a coarse search, and subsequently a fine search to identify structures of interest. We assume the availability of two sensors. The first sensor is a low resolution camera that sweeps an area of interest, such as an imaging satellite. We process the low-resolution image data to identify tentative locations of interest and to provide confidence estimates with this identification. This information is provided to a control algorithm for an unmanned air vehicle, which plans a trajectory to inspect closely promising objects subject to fuel constraints. These close inspections provide sequences of images that are combined to give 3-D reconstructions of the area of interest, leading to accurate classification of the structure. In this paper, we describe the design of the three principal algorithms in this system: machine learning processing of coarse resolution data, the near-optimal path planning subject to fuel constraints, and the high-resolution 3-D modeling from multiple 2-D views of a site. We illustrate the performance of our system on sample LANDSAT satellite data, and using a quadrotor with an on-board camera in a laboratory environment.;Ding_2016.txt

An approach is presented to the automatic estimation of mathematical models of such pots from 3D measurements of sherds. A Bayesian approach is formulated beginning with a description of the complete set of geometric parameters that determine the distribution of the sherd measurement data. Matching of fragments and aligning them geometrically into configurations is based on matching break-curves (curves on a pot surface separating fragments), estimated axis and profile curve pairs for individual fragments and configurations of fragments, and a number of features of groups of break-curves. Pot assembly, is a bottom-up maximum likelihood performance-based search. Experiments are illustrated on pots which were broken for the purpose, and on sherds from an archaeological dig located in Petra, Jordan. The performance measure can also be an aposteriori probability, and many other types of information can be included, e.g., pot wall thickness, surface color, patterns on the surface, etc. This can also be viewed as the problem of learning a geometric object from an unorganized set of free-form fragments of the object and of clutter, or as a problem of perceptual grouping.;Cooper_2002.txt

One of the challenging tasks on such data is the accurate segmentation of images into bone and non-bone classes. Many intensity-based segmentation approaches have been proposed to overcome this issue, moving from global-thresholding to robust (semi)automatic methods. However, researchers often resort to laborious manual segmentation when the intensity levels of bone and non-bone material are extremely similar. Recently, deep learning methods have been shown to outperform traditional approaches for image segmentation. Here we propose a novel domain enriched deep network architecture that combines the benefits of deep learning with expert knowledge of bone structure via two components - 1) a representation network capable of extracting features that are more responsive to bone structures and less responsive to non-bone structures, and 2) a segmentation network that utilizes the features obtained from the representation network to perform segmentation. Effective representation filters are obtained through a robust discriminative-features constraint that enables the discovery of novel features and enhances segmentation accuracy. Experiments performed on challenging mCT images of archaeological bones reveal practical merits of our proposal over state-of-the-art alternatives.;yazdani_2019.txt

In this work, we focus on the task of recovering characters and symbols from images of corrupted archaeological artifacts where data is partially erased, occluded, or overwritten by other data. Such phenomena can be widely observed in image datasets of palimpsests and petroglyphs consisting of erased, overwritten, and in general heavily degraded data. Segmentation and binarization are typically applied to such images to detect and recover characters and symbols from their background. However, these methods mainly focus on the visible data while in our case, due to large corruption, both visible and invisible information should be considered. For example, computing the segmentation mask of an occluded character requires also labeling invisible pixels and missing parts. In this work, we introduce a deep neural network that computes character segmentation in palimpsests and petroglyphs while overcoming occlusions, missing parts, and degradation. Our network has inference abilities, thus, not only segmenting the symbol's foreground pixels but also inferring and completing missing and corrupted parts. Since palimpsests and petroglyphs have very limited annotated ground-truth data, we also introduce data augmentation tools to properly train our network. We demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative performance of our method also including a user study involving expert evaluation.;Melnik et al. - 2022 - Deep Segmentation of Corrupted Glyphs.txt

In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method to extract reliefs for the inscription from a rough stele surface. Relief candidate segments are initially obtained by using a curvature-based method, which include not only actual reliefs but also noises such as dents and scratches. Then, relief segments are selected using a support vector machine classifier that is trained with various features extracted from relief candidate segments. While conventional methods using a single geometric feature easily fail to detect reliefs from the rough surface, the proposed method utilizes 79-dimensional features consisting of appearance-based, cross section-based, and local extrema-based characteristics of each candidate segment to determine whether the segment is relief or not. Using the proposed method, the inscription of the stele Musul-ojakbi made during the Silla Dynasty AD578 were completely recognized.

Through its ability to penetrate forest canopies and detect microlandforms, Airborne Laser Scanning data reveal archaeological relics over large areas, from periods older than the first available Historical Topographic Maps. Mapping these traces from ALS-derived data (e.g. Digital Elevation Model (DEM)) thus allows for a determination of a new temporal baseline in order to evaluate the effects of a longer history on current patterns of biodiversity. Here, we evaluate the ability of traditional machine learning (Random Forest-RF) and deep learning (Fully Connected Networks-FCN) models to detect Medieval Terraced slopes and Ridges and Furrows (RaF) from an ALS-derived DEM in the southern Vosges (1462 km(2)). We used a combination of Local Binary Patterns and topographical metrics to measure properties of FFS and to train detection models. We then assessed the relative performance of each model semantically and spatially. Our results demonstrated the high suitability of our approach for reproducing major trends in the landscape with a high level of similarity between the predicted and reference spatial patterns (Structural Similarity Index - SSIM > 0.75). RF outperformed FCN for Terraced Slopes, whilst minimizing the false positive rate. FCN slightly outperformed RF for the RaF dataset but showed promising abilities to survey unseen data with a low sensitivity to annotation errors.

The project has developed two complementary machine-learning tools to propose identifications based on images captured on site. One method relies on the shape of the fracture outline of a sherd; the other is based on decorative features. For the outline-identification tool, a novel deeplearning architecture was employed, integrating shape information from points along the inner and outer surfaces. The decoration classifier is based on relatively standard architectures used in image recognition. In both cases, training the classifiers required tackling challenges that arise when working with real-world archaeological data: the paucity of labelled data; extreme imbalance between instances of the different categories; and the need to avoid neglecting rare types and to take note of minute distinguishing features of some forms. The scarcity of training data was overcome by using synthetically-produced virtual potsherds and by employing multiple data-augmentation techniques.

In this analysis, the virtual specimen needs to be segmented to separate different parts or materials, a process that normally requires considerable human effort. In the Automated SEgmentation of Microtomography Imaging (ASEMI) project, we developed a tool to automatically segment these volumetric images, using manually segmented samples to tune and train a machine learning model. For a set of four specimens of ancient Egyptian animal mummies we achieve an overall accuracy of 94-98% when compared with manually segmented slices, approaching the results of off-the-shelf commercial software using deep learning (97-99%) at much lower complexity. A qualitative analysis of the segmented output shows that our results are close in terms of usability to those from deep learning, justifying the use of these techniques.;Tanti et al. - 2021 - Automated segmentation of microtomography imaging .txt
E7QG4Q7M;journalArticle;2022;"Bouzid, S; Barge, O";Towards a typology of desert kites combining quantitative and spatial approaches;ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES;Desert kites are very large archaeological constructions discovered in large numbers during the last decade thanks to their identification on satellite images. The geographical area where they are present is considerable, from the Aralo-Caspian zone to central-western Arabia. Always present, several elements make up the layout of the kites, which makes them singular constructions and identifies them. However, variations in shape or size are observed throughout their extension area. Using qualitative and quantitative variables obtained by observing a sample of kites (10% of the total identified) on high-resolution satellite images, we propose a combination of exploratory statistical analysis, unsupervised machine learning approaches (PCA, clustering and association rules) and spatial analysis (neighbourhood) to establish a clustering of kites based on their morphological descriptions. This work allows to identify groups of kites sharing similar features, each of which is relatively circumscribed in geographic space. This regionalisation of morphologically homogeneous groups of kites could explain the temporality of the constructions while, despite recent fieldwork, dating is still rare.;Bouzid et Barge - 2022 - Towards a typology of desert kites combining quant.txt

Biochar can provide additional agronomic benefits to cropping systems, including improved crop yield, soil water holding capacity, seed germination, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and soil pH. To maximize the beneficial effects of biochar amendments towards the inventory, increase, and management of SOC pools, nondestructive analytical methods such as ground penetrating radar (GPR) are needed to identify and quantify belowground C. The use of GPR has been well characterized across geological, archaeological, engineering, and military applications. While GPR has been predominantly utilized to detect relatively large objects such as rocks, tree roots, land mines, and peat soils, the objective of this study was to quantify comparatively smaller, particulate sources of SOC. This research used three materials as C sources: biochar, graphite, and activated C. The C sources were mixed with sand-12 treatments in total-and scanned under three moisture levels: 0%, 10%, and 20% to simulate different soil conditions. GPR attribute analyses and Naive Bayes predictive models were utilized in lieu of visualization methods because of the minute size of the C particles. Significant correlations between GPR attributes and both C content and moisture levels were detected. The accuracy of two predictive models using a Naive Bayes classifier for C content was trivial but the accuracy for C structure was 56%. The analyses confirmed the ability of GPR to identify differences in both C content and C structure. Beneficial future applications could focus on applying GPR across more diverse soil conditions.;Shen et al. - 2019 - Quantification of Soil Organic Carbon in Biochar-A.txt

Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) models constructed with device-specific portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) source catalogs benefit from the precision of individual pXRF machines and the ability of PLS-DA to handle highly correlated data sets to provide a source classification system that complements existing methods. Of the known obsidian sources in or near Southeast Alaska, four are identified in early Holocene archaeological assemblages: Obsidian Cove and Aguada Cove on Suemez Island, Mount Edziza in the Coast Mountain Range, and a newly identified source on Zim Creek, Kupreanof Island. A comprehensive reanalysis of early Holocene microblade cores (101 cores from 13 archaeological sites) across Southeast Alaska confirms the presence of exotic obsidian from Mount Edziza in one of the oldest sites, alongside possible evidence of landscape learning: testing of the obsidian source on Kupreanof Island. The dominance of the Obsidian Cove source for microblade core production supports hypotheses framing Northwest Coast microblade core morphology as an adaptation to the small nodules of raw material available at the source. A simple distance-decay model indicates no relationship between core reduction intensity and distance from the source, suggesting high forager mobility characterized by regular trips to Suemez Island (a voyage of up to 380 km) throughout the early Holocene.;Schmuck-2022-Obsidian source classification an.txt

Chinese people consider these artifacts as symbols of their cultural heritage. The development of technology has helped in the identification of ancient artifacts to a greater extent. The study preferred machine-learning algorithms to identify the ancient artifacts found throughout China. The major cities of China were selected for the study and classified the cities based on different features like temple, modern city, harbour, battle, and South China. The study used a decision tree algorithm for recognition and gradient boosting for perception aspects. According to the findings of the study, the algorithms produced 98% accuracy and prediction in detecting ancient artifacts in China.

9NJQNQDW;journalArticle;2018;Carranza, E;The study of lithic assemblages on deflation surfaces: The case study of Arroyo Verde, Northern Patagonia coast, Argentina;JOURNAL OF LITHIC STUDIES;This paper focuses on surface lithic artefacts from Holocene coastal hunter gatherer occupations of Arroyo Verde archaeological locality (Rio Negro province, Northern Patagonia, Argentina). The study of lithic assemblages collected at a deflation surface surrounded by stabilised sand dunes near the coastline, shows that wind produce significant corrasion (wind abrasion) of artefacts and affects preservation of small and medium size artefacts. The sample is mainly composed of chert knapping debitage with abraded and polished edges and surfaces. The artefact size distribution suggests that a subset of the assemblage exhibits good preservation, possibly due to the recent subaerial exposure. Furthermore, carbonate and mould coatings were recorded over the artefacts surface in contact with the ground, which indicates the presence of humid conditions in the sand dunes deflation area. In order to explore the factors that affected assemblage stability conditions in the locus, a machine learning based decision tree was applied. The model predicts and defines a threshold at which the occurrence of instability conditions may appear. Also, it suggests that relative altitude of artefacts within the deflation hollow is the primary variable explaining the exposure conditions recorded in the artefacts and it points out processes of differential deflation over time. The data presented here illustrates how wind alters local surface materials and emphasizes that a taphonomic perspective is needed to assess the formation processes within northern Patagonia coastal archaeological assemblages.;Carranza - 2018 - The study of lithic assemblages on deflation surfa.txt

We present a catalog of common forms of relict charcoal hearths (RCHs) in Central Europe to improve the evaluation of morphologic and genetic features in future mapping approaches. RCHs are important historical landscape features created from the production of charcoal. RCHs are noted in Central Europe from the Medieval Period, but also are widespread near (pre-)industrial mining centers. Different forms of charcoal hearths were created by workers known as colliers, and their hearth building techniques may have differed on a regional scale. Our catalog is based on a morphologic-genetic grouping of RCHs. Due to topographic effects, reuse of production sites, or local techniques, this catalog is nonexhaustive, but most RCHs in Central Europe can be grouped into one of seven types.;Hirsch et al. - 2020 - An initiative for a morphologic-genetic catalog of.txt

DJ7IKC8H;journalArticle;2021;"Bordon, P; Martinelli, P; Medina, PZ; Bonomo, N; Ratto, NR";Automatic detection of mud-wall signatures in ground-penetrating radar data;ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION;The ground-penetrating radar (GPR) method with the standard constant-offset reflection mode allows to detect and map different types of archaeological structures, such as walls, foundations, floors and roads. The interpretation of the GPR data usually involves a detailed and time-consuming analysis of large amounts of information, which entails nonnegligible chances of errors, especially under nonideal fieldwork conditions. The application of suitable automatic detection algorithms can be useful to more rapidly and successfully complete the interpretation task. In this work, we explore the use of supervised machine learning methodologies to automatically detect mud-wall signatures in radargrams and to map the structures from these detections. Several algorithms, based on Viola-Jones cascade classifiers and the image feature descriptors Haar, histogram of oriented gradients and local binary patterns, were implemented. These algorithms were applied to datasets previously acquired in pre-Inca and Inca-Hispanic sites located in the Andean NW region of Argentina. The best algorithms provided very good detection rates for well-preserved walls and acceptable rates for deteriorated walls, with a low number of spurious predictions. They also exhibited the ability to detect collapsed walls and fragments detached from them. These are remarkable results because mud walls are usually difficult to be detected by conventional analysis, owing to the complex and variable characteristics of their reflection patterns. The results of the automatic detection techniques were represented in plan views and three-dimensional (3D) views that delineated in detail most of the structures of the sites. These algorithms are very fast, so applying them significantly reduces the interpretation times. In addition, once they have been trained using the patterns of one or several sites, they are directly applicable to other sites with similar characteristics.;arp.1799.txt

These clouds usually comprise millions of unrelated points and are not presented in an efficient data structure, making them complicated to use. Furthermore, point clouds do not contain topological or semantic information on the elements they represent. Added to these difficulties is the fact that a variety of different kinds of sensors and measurement methods are used in study and documentation work: photogrammetry, LIDAR, etc. Each point cloud must be fused and integrated so that decisions can be taken based on the total information supplied by all the sensors used. A system must be devised to represent the discrete set of points in order to organise, structure and fuse the point clouds. In this work we propose the concept of multispectral voxels to fuse the point clouds, thus integrating multisensor information in an efficient data structure, and applied it to the real case of a building element in an archaeological context. The use of multispectral voxels for the fusion of point clouds integrates all the multisensor information in their structure. This allows the use of very powerful algorithms such as automatic learning and machine learning to interpret the elements studied.;Raimundo et al. - 2022 - Multisensor Data Fusion by Means of Voxelization .txt

This paper aims to appraise the potential of the multispectral constellation Sentinel-2 of the European Commission Earth observation programme Copernicus to detect prominent features and changes in heritage sites, during both ordinary times and crisis. We test the 10 m spatial resolution of the 3 visible spectral bands of Sentinel-2 for substantiation of single local events-that is, wall collapses in the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Old City of Aleppo (Syria)-and for hotspot mapping of recurrent incidents-that is, the archaeological looting in the archaeological site of Apamea (Syria). By screening long Sentinel-2 time series consisting of 114 images for Aleppo and 57 images for Apamea, we demonstrate that changes of textural properties and surface reflectance can be logged accurately in time and space and can be associated to events relevant for conservation. VHR imagery from Google Earth was used for the validation and identification of trends occurring prior to the Sentinel-2 launch. We also demonstrate how to exploit the Sentinel-2 short revisiting time (5 days) and large swath (290 km) for multi-temporal tracking of spatial patterns of urban sprawl across the cultural landscape of the World Heritage Site of Cyrene (Libya), and the three coastal ancient Greek sites of Tocra, Ptolemais, and Apollonia in Cyrenaica.

We sought to isolate the biophysical predictors that explain forest loss in the pre-historic (i.e. pre-European) period in New Zealand. Location New Zealand. Methods We used resampled boosted regression trees to isolate the key predictors of forest loss from a suite of 19 topographic, climatic, soil-related and archaeological predictors at a 1-km spatial resolution across New Zealand. Results The key predictors of fire-driven forest loss during New Zealand's pre-history relate to moisture and elevation gradients, with sites characterized by low moisture levels and gentle slopes being most vulnerable. Proxies for human activity were important in the North Island, where Maori population densities were higher, but not the South Island. The predicted pattern of forest loss and its relationship with biophysical variables suggest that early Maori neither deliberately protected fire-prone regions nor systematically burnt less fire-prone ones. Main conclusions Before Maori settlement of New Zealand fire was naturally rare, despite biophysical conditions being conducive to fire spread. The introduction of an ignition source by humans made widespread forest loss inevitable, even in the absence of sustained and deliberate use of fire. Rapid forest loss at the time of human settlement is recurrent across eastern Polynesia, so understanding this dynamic in New Zealand has implications for the region as a whole.;j.1466-8238.2011.00745.x.txt

The near exclusive consumption of these millets results in extremely elevated bulk collagen delta C-13 values (similar to-7 parts per thousand to -5 parts per thousand), which serve as natural isotopic tracers in palaeodiet studies. Here we report individual amino acid delta C-13 results (delta C-13(AA)) for humans (n = 12) and animals (n = 9) that consumed varying amounts of millets at the Proto-Shang period (2000-1600 BC) site of Nancheng, China. Using established delta C-13(AA) proxies (Delta C-13(Gly-Phe), Delta C-13(val-Phe), and plots of delta C-13(phe) vs. delta C-13(val), delta C-13(Lys) vs. Delta C-13(Giy-phe), and delta C-13(Lys) vs. Delta C-13(va1-phe)) and machine learning assisted principal component analysis (MLA-PCA), we compared the Nancheng data to published known archaeological C-3, C-4, marine and freshwater protein consumers. Exclusive millet-consuming humans and animals from Nancheng displayed highly C-13-enriched amino acid results, which were distinct from C-4 consumers of maize (Zea mays) in the Americas. Compared to delta C-13(AA) dietary proxies, MLA-PCA provides improved separation for all of the different dietary categories reviewed. Further, this method was able to distinguish additional dietary details, such as identifying brackish species. Increased application of MLA-PCA in palaeodiet research utilizing delta C-13(AA) measurements could create regional and global aminoisoscapes that can reveal unique dietary and environmental information that is otherwise hidden by bulk and existing delta C-13(AA) proxy isotopic analyses.;j.jas.2020.105289.txt

Identification of new star cluster candidates in M 31 is fundamental for the study of the M 31 stellar cluster system. The machine-learning method convolutional neural network (CNN) is an efficient algorithm for searching for new M 31 star cluster candidates from tens of millions of images from wide-field photometric surveys. Aims. We search for new M 31 cluster candidates from the high-quality g- and i-band images of 21 245 632 sources obtained from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) through a CNN. Methods. We collected confirmed M 31 clusters and noncluster objects from the literature as our training sample. Accurate double-channel CNNs were constructed and trained using the training samples. We applied the CNN classification models to the PAndAS g-and i-band images of over 21 million sources to search new M 31 cluster candidates. The CNN predictions were finally checked by five experienced human inspectors to obtain high-confidence M 31 star cluster candidates. Results. After the inspection, we identified a catalogue of 117 new M 31 cluster candidates. Most of the new candidates are young clusters that are located in the M 31 disk. Their morphology, colours, and magnitudes are similar to those of the confirmed young disk clusters. We also identified eight globular cluster candidates that are located in the M 31 halo and exhibit features similar to those of confirmed halo globular clusters.

In contrast with traditional 2D and 3D shape matching approaches, we introduce a set of feature descriptors that are based on not only color and shape, but also normal maps. These are easy to acquire and combine high data quality with discriminability and robustness to some types of deterioration. Our feature descriptors range from general-purpose to domain-specific, and are quick to compute and match. We have tested our system on three datasets of fresco fragments, demonstrating that multi-cue matching using different subsets of features leads to different tradeoffs between efficiency and effectiveness. In particular, we show that normal-based features are more effective than color-based ones at similar computational complexity, and that 3D features are more discriminative than ones based on 2D or normals, but at higher computational cost. We also demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be used to effectively combine our new features with traditional ones. Our results show good retrieval performance, significantly improving upon the match prediction rate of state-of-the-art 3D matching algorithms, and are expected to extend to general matching problems in applications such as texture synthesis and forensics.;Toler-Franklin et al. - 2010 - Multi-Feature Matching of Fresco Fragments.txt

While efforts have been made to independently validate these projections against the archaeological record and contemporary measures of genetic diversity, there has been no comprehensive assessment of how parameter values and choice of palaeoclimate model affect projections of early human migration. We simulated human migration into North America with a process-explicit migration model using simulated palaeoclimate data from two different atmosphere-ocean general circulation models and did a sensitivity analysis on the outputs using a machine learning algorithm. We found that simulated human migration into North America was more sensitive to un-certainty in demographic parameters than choice of atmosphere-ocean general circulation model used for simulating climate-human interactions. Our findings indicate that the accuracy of process-explicit human migration models will be improved with further research on the population dynamics of ancient humans, and that uncertainties in model parameters must be considered in estimates of the timing and rate of human colo-nisation and their consequence on biodiversity.;PILOWSKY_2022.txt

We then document and appraise recent advances in analytical methods used to determine the major, minor, and trace elements of individual glass shards from tephra or cryptotephra deposits to aid their correlation and application. Protocols developed recently for the electron probe microanalysis of major elements in individual glass shards help to improve data quality and standardize reporting procedures. A narrow electron beam (diameter similar to 3-5 gm) can now be used to analyze smaller glass shards than previously attainable. Reliable analyses of 'microshards' (defined here as glass shards < 32 gm in diameter) using narrow beams are useful for fine-grained samples from distal or ultra-distal geographic locations, and for vesicular or microlite-rich glass shards or small melt inclusions. Caveats apply, however, in the microprobe analysis of very small microshards (<=similar to 5 gm in diameter), where particle geometry becomes important, and of microlite-rich glass shards where the potential problem of secondary fluorescence across phase boundaries needs to be recognised. Trace element analyses of individual glass shards using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), with crater diameters of 20 mu m and 10 mu m, are now effectively routine, giving detection limits well below 1 ppm. Smaller ablation craters (< 10 mu m) can be subject to significant element fractionation during analysis, but the systematic relationship of such fractionation with glass composition suggests that analyses for some elements at these resolutions may be quantifiable. In undertaking analyses, either by microprobe or LA-ICP-MS, reference material data acquired using the same procedure, and preferably from the same analytical session, should be presented alongside new analytical data. In part 2 of the review, we describe, critically assess, and recommend ways in which tephras or cryptotephras can be correlated (in conjunction with other information) using numerical or statistical analyses of compositional data. Statistical methods provide a less subjective means of dealing with analytical data pertaining to tephra components (usually glass or crystalsiphenocrysts) than heuristic alternatives. They enable a better understanding of relationships among the data from multiple viewpoints to be developed and help quantify the degree of uncertainty in establishing correlations. In common with other scientific hypothesis testing, it is easier to infer using such analysis that two or more tephras are different rather than the same. Adding stratigraphic, chronological, spatial, or palaeoenvironmental data (i.e. multiple criteria) is usually necessary and allows for more robust correlations to be made. A two-stage approach is useful, the first focussed on differences in the mean composition of samples, or their range, which can be visualised graphically via scatterplot matrices or bivariate plots coupled with the use of statistical tools such as distance measures, similarity coefficients, hierarchical cluster analysis (informed by distance measures or similarity or cophenetic coefficients), and principal components analysis (PCA). Some statistical methods (cluster analysis, discriminant analysis) are referred to as 'machine learning' in the computing literature. The second stage examines sample variance and the degree of compositional similarity so that sample equivalence or otherwise can be established on a statistical basis. This stage may involve discriminant function analysis (DFA), support vector machines (SVMs), canonical variates analysis (CVA), and ANOVA or MANOVA (or its two-sample special case, the Hotelling two-sample T-2 test). Randomization tests can be used where distributional assumptions such as multivariate normality underlying parametric tests are doubtful. Compositional data may be transformed and scaled before being subjected to multivariate statistical procedures including calculation of distance matrices, hierarchical cluster analysis, and PCA. Such transformations may make the assumption of multivariate normality more appropriate. A sequential procedure using Mahalanobis distance and the Hotelling two-sample T-2 test is illustrated using glass major element data from trachytic to phonolitic Kenyan tephras. All these methods require a broad range of high-quality compositional data which can be used to compare 'unknowns' with reference (training) sets that are sufficiently complete to account for all possible correlatives, including tephras with heterogeneous glasses that contain multiple compositional groups. Currently, incomplete databases are tending to limit correlation efficacy. The development of an open, online global database to facilitate progress towards integrated, high-quality tephrostratigraphic frameworks for different regions is encouraged. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

An important adaptive response to these conditions, of uncertain antiquity, has been the hand-excavation of a sequence of deep wells at key locations often along seasonal riverbeds and valley bottoms where subterranean aquifers can be tapped. Sophisticated indigenous water management systems have developed to ensure equitable access to these critical water resources, and these are part of well-defined customary institutional leadership structures that govern the community giving rise to a distinctive form of biocultural heritage. These systems, and the wells themselves, are increasingly under threat, however, from climate change, demographic growth, and socio-economic development. To contribute to an assessment of the scale, distribution and intensity of these threats, this study aimed to evaluate the land-use land-cover (LULC) and precipitation changes in this semi-arid to arid landscape and their association with, and impact on, the preservation of traditional wells. Multitemporal Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite imagery covering the period 1990 to 2020, analysed at a temporal resolution of 10 years, was classified using supervised classification via the Random Forest machine learning method to extract the following classes: bare land, grassland, shrub land, open forest, closed forest, croplands, settlement and waterbodies. Change detection was then applied to identify and quantify changes through time and landscape degradation indices were generated using the Shannon Diversity Index fragmentation index within a 15 km buffer of each well cluster. The results indicated that land cover change was mostly driven by increasing anthropogenic changes with resultant reduction in natural land cover classes. Furthermore, increased fragmentation has occurred within most of the selected buffer distances of the well clusters. The main drivers of change that have directly or indirectly impacted land degradation and the preservation of indigenous water management systems were identified through an analysis of land cover changes in the last 30 years, supporting insights from previous focused group discussions with communities in Kenya and Ethiopia. Our approach showed that remote sensing methods can be used for the spatially explicit mapping of landscape structure around the wells, and ultimately towards assessment of the preservation status of the indigenous wells.;Ochungo et al. - 2022 - Remote Sensing for Biocultural Heritage Preservati.txt

We collected, localized and digitized more than 1800 core drilling data to gain a representative network of stratigraphical information covering the entire plain. Besides other stratigraphical data including the characteristics of the pre-AD 79 stratum, the depth to the pre-AD 79 surface was identified from the available drilling documentations. Instead of a simple interpolation method, we used a machine based learning approach based on classification and regression trees to reconstruct the pre-AD 79 topography. We hypothesize that the present-day topography reflects the ancient topography and related surface processes, because volcanic deposits from the AD 79 eruption coated the ancient landscape. Thus, ancient physiographic elements of the Sarno River plain are still recognizable in the present-day topography. Therefore, a high-resolution, present-day digital elevation model (DEM) was generated. A detailed terrain analysis yielded 15 different primary and secondary topographic indices. Subsequently, a classification and regression model was applied to predict the depth of the pre-AD 79 surface combining present-day topographic indices with other physiographic data. This model was calibrated with the measured depth of the pre-AD 79 surface. The resulting pre-AD 79 DEM was compared with the classified characteristic of the pre-AD 79 stratum, identified from the drilling documentations. This allowed the reconstruction of pre-AD 79 environmental features of the Sarno River plain such as the ancient coastline, the paleo-course of the Sarno River and its floodplain. To the knowledge of the authors, it is the first time that the pre-AD 79 topography of the Sarno River plain was systematically reconstructed using a detailed database and sophisticated data mining technologies.

Toward that effort, 2D and 3D digital representations are gradually replacing the traditional recording of the findings through photos or drawings. The present paper refers to a project that aims to create 3D textured models of two lekythoi that are exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens in Greece; on the surfaces of these lekythoi scenes of the adventures of Odysseus are depicted. The project is expected to support the production of an educational movie and some other relevant interactive educational programs for the museum. The creation of accurate developments of the paintings and of accurate 3D models is the basis for the visualization of the adventures of the mythical hero. The data collection was made by using a structured light scanner consisting of two machine vision cameras that are used for the determination of geometry of the object, a high resolution camera for the recording of the texture, and a DLP projector. The creation of the final accurate 3D textured model is a complicated and tiring procedure which includes the collection of geometric data, the creation of the surface, the noise filtering, the merging of individual surfaces, the creation of a c-mesh, the creation of the UV map, the provision of the texture and, finally, the general processing of the 3D textured object. For a better result a combination of commercial and in-house software made for the automation of various steps of the procedure was used. The results derived from the above procedure were especially satisfactory in terms of accuracy and quality of the model. However, the procedure was proved to be time consuming while the use of various software packages presumes the services of a specialist.";SOILE_2013.txt
HI4ZSRIE;journalArticle;2021;"Finlayson, S; Bogacz, B; Mara, H; Panagiotopoulos, D";Searching for ancient Aegean administrators: Computational experiments on identical seal impressions;JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE;Seals and sealings were widely used in Neopalatial Crete, primarily in community-wide administrative systems to manage the movement and storage of goods, but also to secure or control channels of intra-site communication using parchment documents. The main principle of this monitoring process was the use of the seal impression as an 'indexical' sign, that is, as a means of identifying a seal-user who was acting in an authorising or securing role. Given the fact that seal-users could be acting on their own behalf or, alternatively, as representatives of an institution, there is uncertainty in the literature still over whether the seal impression stood for a single identifiable individual or not. In this paper, we present a new computational methodology for identifying and quantifying similarity within sets of multiple seal impressions made by the same seal. Using a combination of visualisations derived from computational analysis of 3-D scans, experimental work to make seal impressions, and scrutiny of the relevant sealing casts within the Corpus of Minoan and Mycenaean Seals, Heidelberg, we are able to identify groups of sealings impressed in significantly similar ways. We consider it probable that seal impressions with a high degree of similarity were made by the same individual or by two or more people trained to work in a very specific way. This computational methodology is transferable and would prove valuable for other collections of material with identifiable repeated visual elements, such as coins. The implications of our research and the nuance it adds to reconstructions of Neopalatial sealing practices are of broader relevance for sphragistic studies, and provide a point of comparison with the contemporary sealing material of the Ancient Near East.;FINLAYSON_2021.txt

Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has become a powerful technology to support various applications such as collecting real-time aquatic information, naval military applications, maritime security, natural disaster prediction and control, archaeological expeditions, oil and gas exploration, shipwrecks discovery, water contamination, marine life observation and smart Ocean. IoUT is referred as smart intricately linked underwater objects to monitor these underwater operations. The IoUT framework incorporates several underwater communication technologies based on magnetic induction, optical signals, radio signals and acoustic waves. It is an emerging communication ecosystem which can reveal a new era of research, business and naval applications. It is a novel and vibrant paradigm for the Blue Economy sector bringing the ability to communicate autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), sensing, actuating and transferring this data to control centers using regular internet speeds through low cost technologies. It is anticipated to support future networking systems which can bring tremendous improvement in previous generations in terms of stable networking, high coverage, massive connectivity, low latency, high data rate and low power consumption. This study introduces the possible network framework of IoUT which is naturally heterogeneous and must be flexible enough to work under unpredicted ocean conditions. In this study, we examine channel models, routing protocols, networking topologies and simulation tools. Furthermore, we discussed recent advancements in IoUT in terms of smart devices, consumer electronics, communication and role of AUVs. In addition, edge computing, optical wireless communication (OWC), data analytics, blockchain, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) and machine learning were viewed as promising techniques to support IoUT. We have dedicated a complete section to applications of IoUT. Finally, numerous open research challenges and future directions were presented. We believe this survey will be helpful to aggregate the research efforts and eliminate the technical uncertainties towards breakthrough novelties of IoUT.;Mohsan et al. - 2022 - Towards the internet of underwater things a compr.txt
8IRTQ249;journalArticle;2010;"Aertsen, W; Kint, V; van Orshoven, J; Ozkan, K; Muys, B";Comparison and ranking of different modelling techniques for prediction of site index in Mediterranean mountain forests;ECOLOGICAL MODELLING;Forestry science has a long tradition of studying the relationship between stand productivity and abiotic and biotic site characteristics, such as climate, topography, soil and vegetation. Many of the early site quality modelling studies related site index to environmental variables using basic statistical methods such as linear regression. Because most ecological variables show a typical non-linear course and a non-constant variance distribution, a large fraction of the variation remained unexplained by these linear models. More recently, the development of more advanced non-parametric and machine learning methods provided opportunities to overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, these methods also have drawbacks. Due to their increasing complexity they are not only more difficult to implement and interpret, but also more vulnerable to overfitting. Especially in a context of regionalisation, this may prove to be problematic. Although many non-parametric and machine learning methods are increasingly used in applications related to forest site quality assessment, their predictive performance has only been assessed for a limited number of methods and ecosystems. In this study, five different modelling techniques are compared and evaluated, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), generalized additive models (GAM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Each method is used to model site index of homogeneous stands of three important tree species of the Taurus Mountains (Turkey): Pinus brutia, Pinus nigra and Cedrus libani. Site index is related to soil, vegetation and topographical variables, which are available for 167 sample plots covering all important environmental gradients in the research area. The five techniques are compared in a multi-criteria decision analysis in which different model performance measures, ecological interpretability and user-friendliness are considered as criteria. When combining these criteria, in most cases GAM is found to outperform all other techniques for modelling site index for the three species. BRT is a good alternative in case the ecological interpretability of the technique is of higher importance. When user-friendliness is more important MLR and CART are the preferred alternatives. Despite its good predictive performance, ANN is penalized for its complex, non-transparent models and big training effort. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;j.ecolmodel.2010.01.007.txt

Here we compile the largest dataset of past diet derived from stable isotope delta C-13 parts per thousand and delta N-15 parts per thousand values in the Americas to quantitatively evaluate the impact of 7000 years of climatic and demographic change on dietary variation in the Central Andes. Specifically, we couple paleoclimatic data from a general circulation model with estimates of relative past population inferred from archaeologically derived radiocarbon dates to assess the influence of climate and population on spatiotemporal dietary variation using an ensemble machine learning model capable of accounting for interactions among predictors. Results reveal that climate and population strongly predict diet (80% of delta 15N parts per thousand and 66% of delta 13C parts per thousand) and that Central Andean diets correlate much more strongly with local climatic conditions than regional population size, indicating that the past 7000 years of dietary change was influenced more by climatic than socio-demographic processes. Visually, the temporal pattern suggests decreasing dietary variation across elevation zones during the Late Horizon, raising the possibility that sociopolitical factors overrode the influence of local climatic conditions on diet during that time. The overall findings and approach establish a general framework for understanding the influence of local climate and demography on dietary change across human history.";Wilson et al. - 2022 - Climate and demography drive 7000 years of dietary.txt

Since the number of possible 3D configurations is considerably large, the exhaustive manual trial may result in abrasion on fractured surfaces and even failure to find the correct matches. As a result, many recent works suggest virtual reassembly from 3D scans of the fragments. The problem is challenging in the view of the conventional 3D geometric analysis, as it is hard to extract reliable shape features from the thin break lines. We propose to optimize for the global configuration by combining geometric constraints with information from noisy shape features. Specifically, we enforce bijection and continuity of sequence of correspondences given estimates of corners and pair-wise matching scores between multiple break lines. We demonstrate that our pipeline greatly increases the accuracy of correspondences, resulting in stable restoration of 3D configurations from irregular and noisy evidence.;icpr48806.2021.9412372.txt
KPDHY4U2;journalArticle;2022;"Zhang, XW; Aliaga, D";RFCNet: Enhancing urban segmentation using regularization, fusion, and;COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING;Image segmentation is a fundamental task that has benefited from recent advances in machine learning. One type of segmentation, of particular interest to computer vision, is that of urban segmentation. Although recent solutions have leveraged on deep neural networks, approaches usually do not consider regularities appearing in facade structures (e.g., windows are often in groups of similar alignment, size, or spacing patterns) as well as additional urban structures such as building footprints and roofs. Moreover, both satellite and street view images are often noisy and occluded, thus getting the complete structure segmentation from a partial observation is difficult. Our key observations are that facades and other urban structures exhibit regular structures, and additional views are often available. In this paper, we present a novel framework (RFCNet) that consists of three modules to achieve multiple goals. Specifically, we propose Regularization to improve the regularities given an initial segmentation, Fusion that fuses multiple views of the segmentation, and Completion that can infer the complete structure if necessary. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively for multiple facade datasets. Furthermore, by applying our framework to other urban structures (e.g., building footprints and roofs), we demonstrate our approach can be generalized to various pattern types.;ZHANG_2022.txt

Accounts of apparent mythological nature and archaeological evidence indicate cultural contacts. To what extent did Greek craftsmen learn their ail from Egyptians? At excavations in Djoser's pyramid (3rd dynasty, ca. 2750 13C) sonic 36000 glazed tiles were found. most with a turqoise-blue glaze coating but also many with other colours. The glazing process has been interpreted as a self-glazing process involving alkali salts, copper oxide (CuO) and firing temperatures of around 850 degrees C. One investigation (Schiegel, 1988) indicated that this glaze was composed mainly of quartz, tenorite and water with a minor amount of alkalis, iron. phosphorus and chlorine. The interpretation of the data as indicative of the presence of chemically bound water is rather puzzling if such high temperatures were indeed used to produce the,laze oil these tiles, and in such large quantities.An alternative explanation has been proposed (Davidovits, 2005) according to which what is needed in order to replicate this self-glazing process is soluble silicate SiO2, K2O, Na2O + synthetic turquoise (inafkat), aluminium phosphate hydrate + copper phosphate hydrate and a firing temperature of 250'C. The resulting glaze call be described its it geopolynier-type material where the vitrified matfix is (K, Na)-Poly(Sialate-decaSiloxo), (Si-O-Al-O)-(Si-O-) 10. The process call be controlled to produce blue (K+) or green (Na+) at 250'C or black at 350'C in the presence of Cu-phosphate, Cu-silicate and tenorite, or beige in the presence of' Fe-salts (phosphate, arsenate). The process results in a vitreous matrix with the appearance of a fitience-type material and with a composition corresponding to the starting materials. We have used a number of techniques to characterise this turqUoise-blue --copolymer glaze\ produced experimentally by Davidovits. Synchrotron-XRD of'sinall flakes front the outer blue surface layer and the white inner core was used to determine the %weight ofthe diffracting phases as well as the amorphous component which constitutes some 87% ofthe scattering mass. SEM/EDS was employed to study the vitreous matrix morphology as well as the local elemental composition. Raman spectroscopy was used to correlate the other observations with the Molecular composition of the areas examined. It is an appealing thought, that ancient craftsmen were as ingenious in matters of solid state chemistry and metallurgy as present-day industrial materials scientists.

The sampled layers were deposited during the Holocene, and provide evidence of riparian ecology in the region since the end of the last glacial interval. The samples were processed to extract sub-fossil macroremains (including seeds, fruits, and aquatic and terrestrial mollusc shells). Macrofossils are particularly useful for creating fine-resolution (site-specific) reconstructions. An innovative aspect of this study was the derivation of regional bioclimatic trends through time. This was achieved by applying a dual-layered weighted calibration function which incorporated the relative productivity of indicator taxa, their modelled climatic optima, and the influence of climate (temperature and precipitation) on their ecological niche. Optima and climatic influence values were calculated using the machine-learning maximum entropy environmental niche modelling tool, MAXENT, trained on global occurrence records for the taxa. This study aimed to address gaps in prior palaeoenvironmental research, allowing for a spatially explicit quantitative reconstruction of climate in the transitional foothill region near Calgary. Results indicated warm conditions immediately following glacial retreat, followed by an early to mid-Holocene cooling which coincided with the driest interval. Temperature and moisture regimes oscillated in the mid-Holocene, exhibiting the highest values for both parameters. Increased moisture was at least in part prompted by increased input from summer glacial meltwater (the result of higher summer temperatures) which added to the riparian water budget. The mid-to late Holocene, and up to modern times, showed a gradual decrease in both moisture and temperature, until stabilizing near the Holocene average.;BOLTON_2017.txt

In the present article, a small subset of the freely available online Goldman Data Set is used to illustrate the use of this package on real osteometric data, and some methodological caveats that regularly arise with archeological samples are discussed. Finally, some terminological elements are clarified or modified from the seminal publication. Further technical documentation about rdss, including a video tutorial, is available online.""";oa.2957.txt

They demonstrate the importance of understanding the emergence and evolution of perceptual-motor coupling not only in complex motor skill learning. Stone toolmaking is a human motor skill which provides the earliest archeological evidence motor skill and social learning. Intentionally shaping a stone into a functional tool relies on the interaction of action observation and practice to support motor skill acquisition. The emergence of adaptive and efficient visuomotor processes during motor learning of such a novel motor skill requiring complex semantic understanding, like stone toolmaking, is not understood. Through the examination of eye movements and motor skill, the current study sought to evaluate the changes and relationship in perceptuomotor processes during motor learning and performance over 90 h of training. Participants' gaze and motor performance were assessed before, during and following training. Gaze patterns reveal a transition from initially high gaze variability during initial observation to lower gaze variability after training. Perceptual changes were strongly associated with motor performance improvements suggesting a coupling of perceptual and motor processes during motor learning.;Bayani et al. - 2021 - Emergence of perceptuomotor relationships during p.txt
NL8FJH6G;journalArticle;2020;"Ibrahim, Y; Nagy, B; Benedek, C";Deep Learning-Based Masonry Wall Image Analysis;REMOTE SENSING;In this paper we introduce a novel machine learning-based fully automatic approach for the semantic analysis and documentation of masonry wall images, performing in parallel automatic detection and virtual completion of occluded or damaged wall regions, and brick segmentation leading to an accurate model of the wall structure. For this purpose, we propose a four-stage algorithm which comprises three interacting deep neural networks and a watershed transform-based brick outline extraction step. At the beginning, a U-Net-based sub-network performs initial wall segmentation into brick, mortar and occluded regions, which is followed by a two-stage adversarial inpainting model. The first adversarial network predicts the schematic mortar-brick pattern of the occluded areas based on the observed wall structure, providing in itself valuable structural information for archeological and architectural applications. The second adversarial network predicts the pixels' color values yielding a realistic visual experience for the observer. Finally, using the neural network outputs as markers in a watershed-based segmentation process, we generate the accurate contours of the individual bricks, both in the originally visible and in the artificially inpainted wall regions. Note that while the first three stages implement a sequential pipeline, they interact through dependencies of their loss functions admitting the consideration of hidden feature dependencies between the different network components. For training and testing the network a new dataset has been created, and an extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation versus the state-of-the-art is given. The experiments confirmed that the proposed method outperforms the reference techniques both in terms of wall structure estimation and regarding the visual quality of the inpainting step, moreover it can be robustly used for various different masonry wall types.;Ibrahim et al. - 2020 - Deep Learning-Based Masonry Wall Image Analysis.txt

The critical cultural relics however actually over the years have faced the brunt of nature. The environmental conditions have deteriorated the condition of many important immovable relics over the years since these could not be just shifted away. People also move around the ancient cultural relics that may also deform these relics. The machine learning algorithms were used to identify the location of the relics. The data from the satellite images were used and implemented machine learning algorithm to maintain and monitor the relics.

CWWDZY95;conferencePaper;2019;"Vitali, F; Assoc Comp Machinery";Beyond Three Dimensions: Managing Space, Time and Subjectivity in your Data;;Why are we digitizing multimedia content of our heritage? Why are we spending important effort and money to create exact digital copies of our pictures, vases, manuscripts, historical archives, early movies and photographs, archeological artefacts, etc.? Why is it important to capture not just the gist and the content of the artefacts, but every minute detail, the texture, the colors, every imperfection, every stain caused by time and handlers that have held and used them across centuries? One possible reason is that the gist and the content of the artefacts are not the only part of them that we are fascinated with. One possible reason is that the stories we want to tell and to be told on these artefacts are about their textures, their colors, their imperfections, their stains. It is the stories, not the artefacts, that are important. Digitized multimedia content and descriptive metadata are important as long as they allow and integrate derivative works: scholarly treaties, divulgation works, text books at schools, touristic guides, travel magazines, art magazines, cultural magazines, etc., are the means through which people access and enjoy our heritage. Without them, we would be left with boring lists of numbers and names and images. Stories not only represent how specific humans see and think about our artefacts: they are points of view that enrich data with context and interpretation, transforming the boring lists of numbers and names and images into interesting narratives that teach and entertain. As such, they are subjective, and they provide context. Getting ready to allow, support, expect and even encourage subjectivity and contextualization in our derivative works, in our stories, require that we also organize the data itself, and the descriptive metadata, to be subjective and contextualized and, more important, multiple. Technologies exist and are plentiful. Yet, few if any datasets and collections of digitized content and descriptive metadata over heritage artefacts are designed and structured from the beginning so as to support and accommodate or handling multiple independent, often inconsistent or contrasting, contextualized points of view over the same asset. We need to learn to embrace complexity and enjoy the disagreements and the scholarly disagreements and conflicts: they represent our understanding of our past much better than monolithic and synthetic points on view and make up for much better and memorable stories, which is what counts.;3347317.3352728.txt
KFD3EVBQ;journalArticle;2017;"Andrew, ME; Shephard, JM";Semi-automated detection of eagle nests: an application of very high-resolution image data and advanced image analyses to wildlife surveys;REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION;Very high-resolution (VHR) image data, including from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms, are increasingly acquired for wildlife surveys. Animals or structures they build (e.g. nests) can be photointerpreted from these images, however, automated detection is required for more efficient surveys. We developed semi-automated analyses to map white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster) nests in VHR aerial photographs of the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia, an important breeding site for many seabird species. Nest detection is complicated by high environmental heterogeneity at the scale of nests (similar to 1-2 m), the presence of many features that resemble nests and the variability of nest size, shape and context. Finally, the rarity of nests limits the availability of training data. These challenges are not unique to wildlife surveys and we show how they can be overcome by an innovative integration of object-based image analyses (OBIA) and the powerful machine learning one-class classifier Maxent. Maxent classifications using features characterizing object texture, geometry and neighborhood, along with limited object color information, successfully identified over 90% of high quality nests (most weathered and unusually shaped nests were also detected, but at a slightly lower rate) and labeled <2% of objects as candidate nests. Although this overestimates the occurrence of nests, the results can be visually screened to rule out all but the most likely nests in a process that is simpler and more efficient than manual photointerpretation of the full image. Our study shows that semi-automated image analyses for wildlife surveys are achievable. Furthermore, the developed strategies have broad relevance to image processing applications that seek to detect rare features differing only subtly from a heterogeneous background, including remote sensing of archeological remains. We also highlight solutions to maximize the use of imperfect or uncalibrated image data, such as some UAV-based imagery and the growing body of VHR imagery available in Google Earth and other virtual globes.;Andrew et Shephard - 2017 - Semi-automated detection of eagle nests an applic.txt

SYPC99CS;journalArticle;2020;Daems, D;A Review and Roadmap of Online Learning Platforms and Tutorials in Digital Archaeology;ADVANCES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRACTICE;Overview With an ever-growing range of computational tools and applications now available for archaeological practice, the potential of digital archaeology is greater than ever before. Yet, archaeological curricula have not always followed suit, and many archaeologists are not up-to-date with the necessary digital skills. To fill this gap, online tutorials and learning platforms are being developed to familiarize archaeologists and students with the potential of digital media for archaeological research practices. Given the essential pedagogical role of these platforms, their quality is deserving of deeper interrogation. Here, I review three major platforms offering tutorials on digital archaeology: the Programming Historian, Project MERCURY-SIMREC, and the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook. These are evaluated and compared based on their goals, design (intuitiveness, ease of use), accessibility (use of jargon, required prerequisite knowledge, software requirements), scope (target audience, range of skills addressed, targeted level of improvement), and efficiency (whether or not they achieve their intended goals). The review concludes with a road map contextualizing the current state of available resources in light of the wider state of digital archaeology, and it considers pathways toward future development.;Daems - 2020 - A Review and Roadmap of Online Learning Platforms .txt

One main goal of paleographers is to identify the different scribes (writers) who wrote a given manuscript. Deep learning has recently received much attention from researchers as classification system and has been applied to many domains. However, this approach is based on the hypothesis that large amount of labeled data are available. To overcome this drawback, transfer learning techniques have been proposed. These techniques use parts of large deep networks, learned by using very large image datasets, as starting points for the learning of networks to solve a more specific classification problem. In this paper, we present a deep transfer learning based tool to help paleographers in identifying the parts of a manuscript that were written by the same writer. The proposed approach has been tested on a set of digital images from a Bible of the XII century. The achieved results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.;bria_2018.txt

Pottery is one of the most abundant materials found in archaeological excavation, yet classification of pottery surface treatments remains challenging. The goal of this study is to propose a workflow to classify pottery surface treatments automatically, based on the extraction of images depicting surface geometry, calculated from 3D models. These images are then classified by Deep Learning. Three Convolutional Neural Network algorithms (VGG16 and VGG19 transfer learning, and a custom network) are quantitatively evaluated on an experimental dataset of 48 wheel-thrown vessels, created by a professional potter specifically for this study. To demonstrate workflow feasibility, six different surface treatments were applied to each vessel. Results obtained for all three classifiers (accuracy of 93 to 95%) surpass other state-of-the-art quantitative approaches proposed for pottery classification. The workflow is able to take into account the entire surface of the pottery, not only a pre-selected spatially limited area.;Wilczek et al. - 2022 - Discrimination of wheel-thrown pottery surface tre.txt

The study focuses on a specific kind of ancient painted pottery from the American Southwest, Tusayan White Ware, but we believe it has broader implications for a wide range of geographical settings and artifact types. Our results show that when properly trained, a deep learning model can assign types to digital images of decorated sherds with an accuracy comparable to, and sometimes higher than, four expert-level contemporary archaeologists. The technique also offers novel tools for visualizing both the importance of diagnostic design elements and overall design relationships between groups of pottery sherds. We demonstrate that this method can objectively match a specific unclassified sherd image to its most similar counterparts through a search of thousands of digital photos. This discovery has important archaeological implications for analyzing time relationships, monitoring stylistic trends, reconstructing fragmentary artifacts, identifying ancient artisans, and studying the evolution and spread of ancient technologies and styles. It also shows how deep learning models can potentially supplement or supplant traditional typologies in favor of more direct groupings and comparisons of artifacts.;Pawlowicz et Downum - 2021 - Applications of deep learning to decorated ceramic.txt

In response, this paper calls for a reconceptualization of technologyas the reconfiguring of space, place, materials, time and social relationsenrolled and refashioned in emergent learning activity. Such reconceptualization requires analytical tools, methods and processes to map heterogeneous assemblages of people, tools and tasks. Educational researchers and designers are in need of approaches and theories that move beyond deterministic accounts about the utility of individual learning technologies, to connect theory, research and practice. Our research shows that in learning to distinguish between elements that are open to alteration through design and those that are not, educational designers gain deeper insights into the flows of matter, information and humans characteristic of productive networked learning environments. And this, in turn, gives rise to valued qualities of emergent learning activity in alignment with current theories about learning. In this paper, we present a series of methods adapted from archaeology and design, illustrating their power in tracing the complex webs of dependence characteristic of productive learning entanglement, with the aim of supporting future design for learning.;bjet.12761.txt

One of the first steps to obtain digital mosaics is the segmentation process to separate (identify) tesserae. Then, various tools are necessary to catalog the digitalized scenes, to extract the figures, such as animal or human beings, from the puzzle of small pieces, to geolocalize the segmented objects and to assign a semantic meaning to them. While some mosaic segmentation approaches have already been reported in the literature, currently, mosaic segmentation is still done by human operators, resulting time consuming and error prone. We propose in this paper an automatic approach, based on Deep Learning, to segment the mosaic floor tesserae of the church of S. Stephen in Umm ar Rasas. Our approach allows to obtain automatically and with good reliability the description of the main elements of a mosaic (the tesserae) that are not homogeneous.

We change the dropout, layer number, and filter number of every layer, so as to improve recognition ability and achieve a prefect recognition rate. By analyzing the mistaken recognitions, we identify some special characters that should be given special data augmentation. In an experiment using 184 difference characters and a dataset consisting of 2,000 images including 538 test images, parameter tuning and data augmentation resulted in the recognition rate of 92.3%, and the training data was augmented into 9.69 million items.;metroarchaeo43810.2018.9089769.txt

A digital version of a mosaic can be useful for archaeologists, scholars and restorers who are interested in studying, comparing and preserving mosaics. Nowadays, archaeologists base their studies mainly on manual operation and visual observation that, although still fundamental, should be supported by an automatized procedure of information extraction. In this context, this research explains improvements which can change the manual and time-consuming procedure of mosaic tesserae drawing. More specifically, this paper analyses the advantages of using Mo.Se. (Mosaic Segmentation), an algorithm that exploits deep learning and image segmentation techniques; the methodology combines U-Net 3 Network with the Watershed algorithm. The final purpose is to define a workflow which establishes the steps to perform a robust segmentation and obtain a digital (vector) representation of a mosaic. The detailed approach is presented, and theoretical justifications are provided, building various connections with other models, thus making the workflow both theoretically valuable and practically scalable for medium or large datasets. The automatic segmentation process was tested with the high-resolution orthoimage of an ancient mosaic by following a close-range photogrammetry procedure. Our approach has been tested in the pavement of St. Stephen's Church in Umm ar-Rasas, a Jordan archaeological site, located 30 km southeast of the city of Madaba (Jordan). Experimental results show that this generalized framework yields good performances, obtaining higher accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Mo.Se. has been validated using publicly available datasets as a benchmark, demonstrating that the combination of learning-based methods with procedural ones enhances segmentation performance in terms of overall accuracy, which is almost 10% higher.

In the last few years, the usage of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) has eased the workload and risks of such interventions. To automate these tasks, the AUVs have to gather the information of their surroundings, interpret it and make decisions based on it. The two main perception modalities used at close range are laser and video. In this paper, we propose the usage of a deep neural network to recognise pipes and valves in multiple underwater scenarios, using 3D RGB point cloud information provided by a stereo camera. We generate a diverse and rich dataset for the network training and testing, assessing the effect of a broad selection of hyperparameters and values. Results show F1-scores of up to 97.2% for a test set containing images with similar characteristics to the training set and up to 89.3% for a secondary test set containing images taken at different environments and with distinct characteristics from the training set.

The Creole are descendants of Europeans and enslaved Africans brought to Belize-a former British colony-for logging in the colonial period. Belizean history in schools focuses heavily on the ancient Maya, which is well documented archaeologically, but Creole history and culture remain largely undocumented and make up only a small component of the social studies curriculum. The development of a community archaeology museum in Crooked Tree aims to address this blind spot. We discuss how cultural sustainability, collaborative partnerships, and the role of education have shaped this heritage-oriented project.

To reduce the number of false positives caused by specific regions in the research area, a novel approach has been developed and implemented called Location-Based Ranking. Experiments show that WODAN2.0 has a performance of circa 70% for barrows and Celtic fields on the small, non-random testing dataset, while the performance on the large, random testing dataset is lower: circa 50% for barrows, circa 46% for Celtic fields, and circa 18% for charcoal kilns.

The increasing quantity of air and space-borne imagery available to archaeologists and the advances in computational science have created an emerging interest in automated archaeological detection. Traditional pattern recognition methods proved to have limited applicability for archaeological prospection, for a variety of reasons, including a high rate of false positives. Since 2012, however, a breakthrough has been made in the field of image recognition through deep learning. We have tested the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated remote sensing detection of archaeological features. Our case study is the qanat systems of the Erbil Plain in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The signature of the underground qanat systems on the remote sensing data are the semi-circular openings of their vertical shafts. We choose to focus on qanat shafts because they are promising targets for pattern recognition and because the richness and the extent of the qanat landscapes cannot be properly captured across vast territories without automated techniques.

A growing number of strategies for the three-dimensional (3D) acquisition and modelling of these invaluable assets have been developed in the last few years. Their objective is to efficiently respond to this documentation need and contribute to deepening the knowledge of the masterpieces investigated constantly by researchers operating in many fieldworks. Nowadays, one of the most effective solutions is represented by the development of image-based techniques, usually connected to a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetric approach. However, while images acquisition is relatively rapid, the processes connected to data processing are very time-consuming and require the operator's substantial manual involvement. Developing deep learning-based strategies can be an effective solution to enhance the automatism level. In this research, which has been carried out in the framework of the digitisation of a wooden maquettes collection stored in the `Museo Egizio di Torino', using a photogrammetric approach, an automatic masking strategy using deep learning techniques is proposed, to increase the level of automatism and therefore, optimise the photogrammetric pipeline. Starting from a manually annotated dataset, a neural network was trained to automatically perform a semantic classification to isolate the maquettes from the background. The proposed methodology allowed the researchers to obtain automatically segmented masks with a high degree of accuracy. The workflow is described (as regards acquisition strategies, dataset processing, and neural network training). In addition, the accuracy of the results is evaluated and discussed. Finally, the researchers proposed the possibility of performing a multiclass segmentation on the digital images to recognise different object categories in the images, as well as to define a semantic hierarchy to perform automatic classification of different elements in the acquired images.;Patrucco et Setragno - 2021 - MULTICLASS SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION FOR DIGITISATION .txt

Deep learning (DL) mask regional-convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNN), which provides context-based instance mapping, offers the potential to overcome many of the difficulties of previous approaches to topographic mapping. We therefore explore the application of Mask R-CNN to extract valley fill faces (VFFs), which are a product of mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States. LiDAR-derived slopeshades are provided as the only predictor variable in the model. Model generalization is evaluated by mapping multiple study sites outside the training data region. A range of assessment methods, including precision, recall, and F1 score, all based on VFF counts, as well as area- and a fuzzy area-based user's and producer's accuracy, indicate that the model was successful in mapping VFFs in new geographic regions, using elevation data derived from different LiDAR sensors. Precision, recall, and F1-score values were above 0.85 using VFF counts while user's and producer's accuracy were above 0.75 and 0.85 when using the area- and fuzzy area-based methods, respectively, when averaged across all study areas characterized with LiDAR data. Due to the limited availability of LiDAR data until relatively recently, we also assessed how well the model generalizes to terrain data created using photogrammetric methods that characterize past terrain conditions. Unfortunately, the model was not sufficiently general to allow successful mapping of VFFs using photogrammetrically-derived slopeshades, as all assessment metrics were lower than 0.60; however, this may partially be attributed to the quality of the photogrammetric data. The overall results suggest that the combination of Mask R-CNN and LiDAR has great potential for mapping anthropogenic and natural landscape features. To realize this vision, however, research on the mapping of other topographic features is needed, as well as the development of large topographic training datasets including a variety of features for calibrating and testing new methods.";Maxwell et al. - 2020 - Mapping the Topographic Features of Mining-Related.txt

As modelling present-day objects hinges on our understanding of their initial conditions, better constraints on turbulence can result in windfalls in Galactic archaeology, star cluster dynamics, and star formation. Observationally, constraining the spectral index of turbulent gas usually involves computing spectra from velocity maps. Here, we suggest that information on the spectral index might be directly inferred from column density maps (possibly obtained by dust emission/absorption) through deep learning. We generate mock density maps from a large set of adaptive mesh refinement turbulent gas simulations using the hydro-simulation code RAMSES. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the resulting images to predict the turbulence index, optimize hyperparameters in validation and test on a holdout set. Our adopted CNN model achieves a mean squared error of 0.024 in its predictions on our holdout set, over underlying spectral indexes ranging from 3 to 4.5. We also perform robustness tests by applying our model to altered holdout set images, and to images obtained by running simulations at different resolutions. This preliminary result on simulated density maps encourages further developments on real data, where observational biases and other issues need to be taken into account.;Trevisan et al. - 2020 - Measuring the spectral index of turbulent gas with.txt

Here we argue that human activity and historical processes deeply transform tropical environments through time, and that these changes accumulate on the landscape affecting social vulnerability. These changes, however, are not always evident due to rapid vegetation growth obscuring past human impact. Our research investigates the northernmost 25 km of the Manati Hydrological Basin in Puerto Rico, focusing on evidence of human activity and environmental characteristics including topography, sediments and vegetation cover. The data collected, which articulates archaeological and ethnographic records, covers the span of pre-Columbian occupation of the region, through the colonial periods, and into the twentieth century. Results show that human activity through time has deeply altered the forests. The accumulation of long-term histories of biotic, abiotic and cultural dynamics affects social sensitivity and exposure. Human ingenuity can widen resilience thresholds, making long-term practices particularly important components of adaptive strategies. Deep-time socioecological perspectives can contribute to current vulnerability assessments by enhancing local and historical records that can feed predictive models and inform decision-making in the present.;Rivera-Collazo et al. - 2018 - A Deep-Time Socioecosystem Framework to Understand.txt

These approaches are generally tested in an (ideal) experimental setting but have not been applied in different contexts or 'in the wild', that is, incorporated in archaeological prospection. This research explores the applicability, knowledge discovery-on both a quantitative and qualitative level-and efficiency gain resulting from employing an automated detection tool called WODAN within (Dutch) archaeological practice. WODAN has been used to detect barrows and Celtic fields in LiDAR data from the Dutch Midden-Limburg area, which differs in archaeology, geo-(morpho)logy and land-use from the Veluwe in which it was developed. The results show that WODAN was able to detect potential barrows and Celtic fields, including previously unknown examples, and provided information about the structuring of the landscape in the past. Based on the results, combined human-computer strategies are argued, in which automated detection has a complementary, rather than a substitute role, to manual analysis. This can offset the inherent biases in manual analysis and deal with the problem that current automated detection methods only detect objects similar to the pre-defined target class(es). The incorporation of automated detection into archaeological prospection, in which the results of automated detection are used to highlight areas of interest and to enhance and add detail to existing archaeological predictive maps, seems logical and feasible.;Verschoof-van der Vaart et Lambers - 2022 - Applying automated object detection in archaeologi.txt

We have therefore set out to learn and test a deep neural network model for classifying from previously manually annotated ancient Maya structures of the Chactun archaeological site in Campeche, Mexico. We considered several variations of the VGG-19 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve the task of classifying visualized example structures from previously manually annotated ALS images of man-made aguadas, buildings and platforms, as well as images of surrounding terrain (four classes and over 12,000 anthropogenic structures).

As part of recent archaeological excavations aimed at understanding the site's transregional trade networks, geoarchaeological analyses were undertaken to document the geomorphic context of the ancient settlement. Here, we outline the results of these field and laboratory studies to discuss patterns of anthropogenic sediment deposition. Unguja Ukuu's deep coastal stratigraphy appears to record progradation of an inhabited back-reef shore from the mid-seventh to the nineth centuries AD, perhaps in the wake of an earlier middle to late Holocene marine transgression. Excavations on the back-beach show that deposits associated with the ancient settlement include interlayered middens, paleofloors, and backshore sands and, in later phases, a peri-urban dump with dark-earth-type anthrosols developed on these deposits. Coastal progradation appears to have been driven in part by the accumulation of anthropogenic detritus and compaction of ancient surfaces. We hypothesize how the inherited, submerged relic Late Pleistocene geomorphology of the intertidal zone and later Holocene sediment supply from the hinterland may have supported the emergence of Unguja Ukuu as a trading locale, and possibly contributed to its decline in the early second millennium AD.;Kotarba-Morley_2022.txt

However, conventional methods rely heavily on visual interpretation by archaeologists and RS specialists, which are difficult to handle the large amount of archaeological traces in massive RS data. Especially for large-scale linear archaeological sites, such as the Great Wall, it is challenging to obtain systematic and complete identification results through human-computer interpretation. Based on the theory of deep learning, we propose an improved DeepLabv3+ model and conduct a typical application of the Great Wall of the Han dynasty (GWH) in northwest (NW) China using very high-resolution (VHR) aerial imagery. The main improvements of the DeepLabv3+ model were (1) replacing the encoder module with pre-trained ResNet101 to obtain deeper features, and (2) adding the Dice coefficient to the loss function to improve the accuracy under the unbalanced condition of positive and negative samples. The experimental evaluation reveals that the improved DeepLabv3+ model achieved accuracy of 98.37%, recall of 98.92%, F1 of 98.64%, and intersection over union (IoU) of 97.32%. Compared with the original model, accuracy, recall, F1, and IoU have improved by 9.03%, 9.13%, 9.08%, and 16.22%, respectively. Furthermore, the identification results in the test area also indicate that the improved model has good transferability. This study provides an automatic approach for surveying and mapping the GWH and indicates the great potential of deep learning in the identification of linear archaeological traces in RS archaeology.;Yang et al. - 2022 - Auto-identification of linear archaeological trace.txt

We identify three preconditions for humans sharing stories: first, the long evolution of language in the different taxa as one of the preconditions of ostensive signaling; second, the pivotal role of childhood in the evolution of collaborative intentionality; and third, the role of fireside chats in the rise of elaborative (i.e., narrative) sharing of stories.

Now that several taphonomic techniques allow identifying carnivore modification of bones, a next step involves determining carnivore type. This is of utmost importance to determine which carnivores were preying on and competing with hominins and what types of interaction existed among them during prehistory. Computer vision techniques using deep architectures of convolutional neural networks (CNN) have enabled significantly higher resolution in the identification of bone surface modifications (BSM) than previous methods. Here, we apply these techniques to test the hypothesis that different carnivores create specific BSM that can enable their identification. To make differentiation more challenging, we selected two types of carnivores (lions and jaguars) that belong to the same mammal family and have similar dental morphology. We hypothesize that if two similar carnivores can be identified by the BSM they imprint on bones, then two more distinctive carnivores (e.g. hyenids and felids) should be more easily distinguished. The CNN method used here shows that tooth scores from both types of felids can be successfully classified with an accuracy greater than 82%. The first hypothesis was successfully tested. The next step will be to differentiate diverse carnivore types involving a wider range of carnivore-made BSM. The present study demonstrates that resolution increases when combining two different disciplines (taphonomy and artificial intelligence computing) in order to test new hypotheses that could not be addressed with traditional taphonomic methods.;Jimenez-Garcia et al. - 2020 - Deep learning improves taphonomic resolution high.txt

Most of the current convolutional neural network (CNN) object-oriented detection techniques are based on a faster region-based CNN (R-CNN) and other one-stage detectors that often lack adequate processing speeds and detection accuracies. Recently, the two-stage detector Mask R-CNN technique achieved impressive results in object detection and instance segmentation problems and was successfully applied in the analysis of archaeological airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. In this study, we outline a modified Mask R-CNN technique that reliably and efficiently detects relict charcoal hearth (RCH) sites on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data-based digital elevation models (DEMs). Using image augmentation and image preprocessing steps combined with the deep learning-based adaptive gradient method with a dynamic bound on the learning rate (AdaBound) optimization technique, we could improve the model's accuracy and significantly reduce its training time. We use DEMs based on high-resolution LiDAR data and the visualization for archaeological topography (VAT) technique that give images with a very strong contrast of the terrain and the outline of the sites of interest in the North German Lowland. Therefore, the model can identify RCH sites with an average recall of 83% and an average precision of 87%. Techniques such as the modified Mask R-CNN method outlined here will help to greatly improve our knowledge about archaeological site densities in the realm of historical charcoal production and past human-landscape interactions.

The difficulties of this problem lie in: 1) these pottery sherds are usually fragmented so that each sherd only covers a small portion of its underlying full design; 2) these sherds can be so highly degraded that curves may contain missing segments or become very shallow; and 3) curve patterns may overlap with each other from the making of these potteries.

ERYIVHUH;journalArticle;2010;Elsner, J;Special issue: Receptions of Pausanias: From Winckelmann to Frazer Introduction;CLASSICAL RECEPTIONS JOURNAL;This volume focuses on the way the creative reading of Pausanias has been pivotal to the formation of new academic disciplines, especially in German and British writing in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. From Winckelmann to Frazer, it charts the significance of deep engagements with Pausanias in the formation of art history, archaeology and anthropology, as well as the Picturesque and certain forms of Romanticism. The introduction traces how engagements with fantasies of Pausanias the man (learned professor, dull reporter, duplicitous Semite) have been crucial for the inflections of his reception over more than 200 years, and how the ancient text's own fight between persistent selectivity and a totalizing aspiration for encapsulating 'all things Greek' is itself key to the various struggles in reception between excerpted and totalizing readings.;Elsner - 2010 - Special issue Receptions of Pausanias From Winck.txt
QHTMQLDM;journalArticle;2020;McNeill, JR;Peak Document and the Future of History;AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW;Among the ongoing revolutions in historical research is the flood of new information about the past that comes not from written documents but from the natural sciences and archaeology. What might this mean for the profession of history, and for our training and institutional practices? How might it affect our research and interpretations of the past? Which fields of history will be most and least affected? I argue for a cautious embrace of the new data about the past coming from the paleosciences, offering a few examples of the promise and perils presented by the work of our natural science and archaeology colleagues. With each passing year, the proportion of our knowledge of the past that derives from the kinds of documents we have learned to read and interpret will shrink, and the proportion that derives from what to most of us are unfamiliar sciences will mount. This has implications. First, the deeper past might make a comeback. The last century or two are the best documented and will likely be least affected by the flood. The intellectual excitement may tip toward the study of earlier centuries where relative significance of information in other formats is greater. Second, the ways in which we train historians may need to change. A possible partial guide to our future as historians is the experience of precolonial Africanists, who are accustomed to research without written documents.;McNeill - 2020 - Peak Document and the Future of History.txt
KYPDLG3A;journalArticle;2019;Carter, BP;Identifying Landscape Modification using Open Data and Tools: The Charcoal Hearths of the Blue Mountain, Pennsylvania;HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY;In this technical brief I demonstrate two methodological points broadly relevant to historical archaeologists. While light detection and ranging (LiDAR), also known as airborne laser scanning (ALS), has been widely used to identify prehistoric archaeological sites, its use in historical archaeology could be expanded. LiDAR data are particularly valuable because they are frequently open access. By coupling open LiDAR data with open source software one can quickly, easily, and inexpensively identify historical landscape modification. I present an illustrative example, the identification of charcoal hearths in Pennsylvania, along with tools and techniques used to carry out the research. This method has allowed us to identify 758 charcoal hearths within a 74 km(2) research area along the Blue Mountain of northeastern Pennsylvania.;Carter - 2019 - Identifying Landscape Modification using Open Data.txt

While the government continues to avoid addressing crimes committed during the Civil War and the subsequent dictatorship, many Spaniards have taken it upon themselves to address the past. The setting is in Abanades, a right-wing pueblo destroyed in battle that rebuilt itself through the collecting and selling of battlefield scrap metal. Whereas some archaeologists and heritage managers view the pueblo's obsession with bombs and bullets as strange, I show how the pueblo's deep affection (carino) for war materials challenges singular narratives of understanding the past. By examining the discovery and care of these materials through sensorial tools - what I call salvage technologies - we can probe the affective mechanics involved in how knowledge of the past is intimately produced and actively challenged in Spain today.;1467-9655.12447.txt

We focused onto the Munsell color space as archaeologists are used to employ the so called Munsell Soil Color Charts (MSCCs) directly in the excavation sites. For these scholars and researchers, being enabled to perform Munsell color specification in an automatic way is crucial, as they spend a lot of time to subjectively specify colors in the Munsell system. We extended the dataset ARCA328, which was specifically thought for the automatic Munsell color specification issue, increasing the number of images from 328 to 1,488, and the number of samples from 56,160 to 315,333. Then, we conducted generalization-tests of color conversion for color specification, adopting a classification approach instead of a regression one. This choice was motivated by the fact that the set of all the possible HVC coordinates in the MSCCs is a discrete one. Hence, we decided to consider each chip in the MSCCs as a class to be learnt and recognized by the SVC. With these tests we highligthed the limits of automatic Munsell color specification without any reference-system or calibration phase. Finally, we gave insights for future works aimed to design automatic illuminant calibration phase and to investigate deep learning approaches, leveraging a synthetic images rendering procedure we also present in this work.

Using compiled archaeological data and a suite of environmental variables, we generate an ensemble species distribution model (SDM) that incorporates general additive models, random forest models and Maxent models to reconstruct spatial patterns of pre-Columbian people that inhabited the Tropical Andes east of the continental divide, within the modern countries of Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador. Within this region, here referred to as the eastern Andean flank, elevation, mean annual cloud frequency, distance to rivers and precipitation of the driest quarter are the environmental variables most closely related to human occupancy. Our model indicates that 11.04% of our study area (65 368 km(2)) was likely occupied by pre-Columbian people. Our model shows that 30 of 351 forest inventory plots, which are used to generate ecological understanding of Andean ecosystems, were likely occupied in the pre-Columbian period. In previously occupied sites, successional trajectories may still be shaping forest dynamics, and those forests may still be recovering from the ecological legacy of pre-Columbian impacts. Our ensemble SDM links palaeo- and neo-ecology and can also be used to guide both future archaeological and ecological studies.

7L7776BI;journalArticle;2021;Sterelny, K;Demography and cultural complexity;SYNTHESE;"This paper begins by calling attention to a puzzling feature of our deep past: an apparent mis-match between morphological evolution in our lineage, including the expansion of our brain and neocortex, and changes in material culture. Three ideas might explain this mis-match. (a) The apparent mis-match is an illusion: change in material culture is indeed driven by biological evolution, but of a kind difficult to identify in the fossil record; (b) the mismatch is caused by the fact that material culture is sensitive to the social and demographic environment, not just the native cognitive capacities of individual agents. Innovation and its uptake is more reliable in larger social worlds. (c) The mis-match is made possible by adaptive phenotypic plasticity; in particular, cognitive plasticity. Just as material culture evolves through cumulative cultural learning, so too do cognitive skills, including ones which make innovations in, and the transmission of, material culture more efficient. This paper is targeted on the second of these ideas, and distinguishes three different versions of the view that increases in social scale support increases in the complexity of material culture. Those are: (i) cultural selection is more efficient in larger social worlds; (ii) larger social worlds support more specialisation, which in turn supports a more complex material culture; (iii) cultural learning is more efficient in larger social worlds. The paper argues that the first two of these pathways are probably more important than the third in explaining otherwise puzzling features of the archaeological and ethnographic record.";Sterelny - 2021 - Demography and cultural complexity.txt

The operation of ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) nevertheless requires significant off-shore dedicated manpower to handle and operate the robotic platform and the supporting vessel. In order to reduce the footprint of operations, DexROV proposes to implement and evaluate novel operation paradigms with safer, more cost effective and time efficient ROV operations. As a keystone of the proposed approach, manned support will in a large extent be delocalized within an onshore ROV control center, possibly at a large distance from the actual operations, relying on satellite communications. The proposed scheme also makes provision for advanced dexterous manipulation and semi-autonomous capabilities, leveraging human expertise when deemed useful. The outcomes of the project will be integrated and evaluated in a series of tests and evaluation campaigns, culminating with a realistic deep sea (1,300 meters) trial in the Mediterranean sea.;OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271691.txt

Here we use this novel method to assess the sedimentary conditions of two of the oldest Oldowan archaeofaunal records (DS and PTK, Bed I) from Olduvai Gorge Bed I in Tanzania. We show how the results support different diagenetic conditions for both penecontemporaneous sites, which are appropriate for their respective locations on the palaeolandscape to which they belonged. We also show how geochemical analyses of the clay deposit that embedded both sites indicate a similar soil pH divergence. PTK was formed on an alluvial sloping surface affected by rills but draining efficiently, which resulted in alkaline soil conditions, that optimised bone-surface preservation. DS occurred in a more depressed area that underwent intermittent flooding, affecting soil chemistry by creating more acidic conditions. This impacted on bone surfaces by dynamically modifying mark morphology. This deep-learning approach has relevance for the interpretation of the local palaeoecological conditions of both assemblages and their respective depositional loci. The results presented here open a new window to the incremental information gain through the use of artificial intelligence methods in taphonomic and palaeoecological research.;Pizarro-Monzo-2022-Determining the diagenetic.txt

259EL3IV;journalArticle;2016;Vorenhout, M;Preserving Medieval Farm Mounds in a Large Stormwater Retention Area;CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES;The Netherlands has denoted large areas as stormwater retention areas. These areas function as temporary storage locations for stormwater when rivers cannot cope with the amount of water. A large area, the Onlanden - 2,500 hectares-was developed as such a storage area between 2008 and 2013. This peat area contains up to 300 medieval housing areas. These 'peatmounds', named after the current visible small mound, were explicitly mentioned as a preservation goal in the project. The preservation of the peatmounds during and after the project has been guaranteed by a combination of protective measures, research, and monitoring actions. At first a risk evaluation was performed, followed by a monitoring project focusing on the preservation of the organic part of the mounds. This evaluation showed that the rewetting of the mounds might improve the overall preservation. A total of fifteen monitoring stations were a-selectively distributed over the total area, covering the four main types of land use. The measured parameters at these stations focus on the desiccation/rewetting effects. The second threat, as determined in the risk evaluation, is the growth of deep penetrating plants. These roots might disturb the archaeological profile. Preventive coverage with plastic and up to a metre of soil could prevent root growth into the archaeology. An experimental coverage showed the effectiveness of this technique, but also the risks. This paper focuses on the lessons that can be learned from this six-year project, the monitoring results, and clearly shows the benefits of a combined approach in large-scale projects.;Vorenhout - 2016 - Preserving Medieval Farm Mounds in a Large Stormwa.txt

Automatic algorithms for image analysis have thus become an invaluable tool in medicine. Examples of this are two- and three-dimensional visualizations, image segmentation, and the registration of all anatomical structure and pathology types. In this context, we introduce Studierfenster (www.studierfenster.at): a free, non-commercial open science client-server framework for (bio-)medical image analysis. Studierfenster offers a wide range of capabilities, including the visualization of medical data (CT, MRI, etc.) in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) space in common web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge. Other functionalities are the calculation of medical metrics (dice score and Hausdorff distance), manual slice-by-slice outlining of structures in medical images, manual placing of (anatomical) landmarks in medical imaging data, visualization of medical data in virtual reality (VR), and a facial reconstruction and registration of medical data for augmented reality (AR). More sophisticated features include the automatic cranial implant design with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the inpainting of aortic dissections with a generative adversarial network, and a CNN for automatic aortic landmark detection in CT angiography images. A user study with medical and non-medical experts in medical image analysis was performed, to evaluate the usability and the manual functionalities of Studierfenster. When participants were asked about their overall impression of Studierfenster in an ISO standard (ISO-Norm) questionnaire, a mean of 6.3 out of 7.0 possible points were achieved. The evaluation also provided insights into the results achievable with Studierfenster in practice, by comparing these with two ground truth segmentations performed by a physician of the Medical University of Graz in Austria. In this contribution, we presented an online environment for (bio-)medical image analysis. In doing so, we established a client-server-based architecture, which is able to process medical data, especially 3D volumes. Our online environment is not limited to medical applications for humans. Rather, its underlying concept could be interesting for researchers from other fields, in applying the already existing functionalities or future additional implementations of further image processing applications. An example could be the processing of medical acquisitions like CT or MRI from animals [Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 84(4):448-456, 68], which get more and more common, as veterinary clinics and centers get more and more equipped with such imaging devices. Furthermore, applications in entirely non-medical research in which images/volumes need to be processed are also thinkable, such as those in optical measuring techniques, astronomy, or archaeology.;Egger et al. - 2022 - Studierfenster an Open Science Cloud-Based Medica.txt
MUPDB7C5;journalArticle;2020;Petursdottir, P;Anticipated futures? Knowing the heritage of drift matter;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HERITAGE STUDIES;What might heritage in and of the Anthropocene look like? This article ponders this question by drawing on archaeological encounters with assemblages of drift matter (seaborne debris) in Norway and Iceland. Here, drift matter manifests evidence of both the relentlessly amassing material heritage of the Anthropocene and deep legacies of local engagement with this fluctuating resource. The tensions evoked along these coastlines therefore invite explorations of some of the challenges met in the current climate, problematizing conceptions of heritage and waste, wanteds and unwanteds, salvation and loss. Surely, drift matter is today largely perceived as not belonging in these natural environs. However, are there other thing lessons to be learned from taking seriously this heritage? Avoiding an interpretation of these things as out of context and a focus merely on what has been lost, this article asks whether it is possible that the sense of ambiguity, flux and drift emitted by this material may not only challenge but also enable alternative possibilities of knowing things - alternatives that may be of significance for a heritage in and of the Anthropocene.;Petursdottir - 2020 - Anticipated futures Knowing the heritage of drift.txt
YDPMYNCC;journalArticle;2022;"Brady, LM; Taylor, L; May, SK; Tacon, PSC";Meaningful choices and relational networks: Analysing western Arnhem Land's Painted Hand rock art style using chaine operatoire;JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY;A core feature of rock art studies concerns the characterisation and analysis of motif styles to generate new insights into their function, meaning, and symbolism in the deep and recent past. Yet what is oftentimes overlooked is attention to the production sequence used to create motifs, and what this can reveal about the social and cultural behaviour of artists. Where it is evident that a particular group of motifs contains a wide range of individual design conventions, questions about why and how these choices were made become points of enquiry that have the potential to develop new insights into their symbolic and relational character, and cultural significance. To address this challenge, we undertook an investigation of the rare and highly distinctive Painted Hand rock art style from western Arnhem Land (Northern Territory, Australia). Using a quantitative, systematic, style-based analysis, and an ethnographic exploration of a select group of distinctive design conventions, we show how the decisions made by artists to use specific design conventions were not random but instead were deeply implicated in, and shaped by, social processes acquired through learning or enculturation.;Brady_2022.txt

It will also shed light on how the site of Bat is perceived by the local community and visitors. Design/methodology/approach The archaeological complex of Bat, al-Khutm, and al-Ayn was listed by the UNESCO as a world heritage site in 1988. Despite this classification, relatively little attention has been given to the management of this site. The author conducted interviews with representatives of the MHC in order to understand how this site is being managed, and the author uploaded an online public questionnaire to learn how the population is being educated about the importance of this heritage. Findings The results of this investigation revealed a surprisingly high level of public awareness about the importance of this site to the country socially, and economically. In spite of this awareness, the site is not visited frequently because it is not adequately equipped: a situation that was clearly outlined by the respondents. Suggestions were proposed in order to better integrate this site into the local development plans and the socio-economic growth of the whole region. Originality/value The originality of this research is that it took the site of investigation an archaeological site listed by the UNESCO for its outstanding universal value and contrary to what is expected, this site was forgotten in all development and management plans executed by the local and central government for almost two decades. It is also the first research about a site in Oman to address such issues and use these methods.;Benkari - 2018 - Archaeological site of Bat-Oman, management and pu.txt

S9PD9YHV;journalArticle;2015;"Beck, W; Haworth, R; Appleton, J";Aboriginal resources change through time in New England upland wetlands, south-east Australia;ARCHAEOLOGY IN OCEANIA;It has previously been assumed that New England high-country environments were not conducive to intense Aboriginal occupation and associated ceremonial activities. How productive were upland wetlands (lagoons) for Aboriginal occupation of high country in eastern Australia through time? Especially during their intermittent phases, upland lagoons provide a diverse and changing mix of deep water, marsh and the green pick of recently exposed lake bed, a rich aggregation of both plant and animal resources not available in other environments. Upland wetlands can be a surprisingly productive Aboriginal resource in an otherwise harsh country, and would at times allow for high population aggregations, such as for ceremonies. We surveyed the ecological literature on New England lagoon characteristics, on vegetation and on birds and other fauna used as resources by Aboriginal people. This was then compared with palaeo-environmental data to prepare an account of potential resources for the New England region over time. We found that overall productivity of lagoons can be high, with large numbers of plant and animal species present in the wetland environment, especially in the early and very late Holocene. Productivity is highest not at the lake-full stage, but when the moist littoral zones are at their most extensive. The reasons for the apparent sparseness of occupation of the high country before the mid-Holocene are unresolved but open to informed speculation about the changing resource inventory of the wetlands, and the mid-Holocene appearance of new technologies that may have enabled more efficient use of resources. In the later Holocene, Aboriginal occupation in upland areas became visible in the record, and included an exceptionally high number of ceremonial sites juxtaposed with the areas of greatest lagoon concentration. This suggests either that these wetlands had become more productive and diverse over time or that people had learnt how to make better use of the available wetland resources, to the point of supporting the larger numbers often associated with ceremonial activity. More research into the location and chronology of wetland archaeological sites is required to resolve the question of whether the apparent early lack of sites is a question of visibility or a real hiatus.;Beck et al. - 2015 - Aboriginal resources change through time in New En.txt

More precisely, to analyze a stock, archaeology, and surveillance, sev-eral cameras are installed underseas to collect videos. However, on the other hand, these large size videos require a lot of time and memory for their processing to extract relevant information. Hence, to automate this manual procedure of video assessment, an accurate and efficient automated system is a greater necessity. From this perspective, we intend to present a complete framework solution for the task of video summarization and object detection in underwater videos. We employed a perceived motion energy (PME) method to first extract the keyframes followed by an object detection model approach namely YoloV3 to perform object detection in underwater videos. The issues of blurriness and low contrast in underwater images are also taken into account in the presented approach by applying the image enhancement method. Furthermore, the suggested framework of underwater video summarization and object detection has been evaluated on a publicly available brackish dataset.

We address one type of completion which is producing a tentative completion of an aerial view of the remnants of a building structure. The inference process may start with as little as 10% of the structure and thus is fundamentally pluralistic (e.g., multiple completions are possible). We present a novel pluralistic building contour completion framework. A feature suggestion component uses an entropy-based model to request information from the user for the next most informative location in the image. Then, an image completion component trained using self-supervision and procedurally generated content produces a partial or full completion. In our synthetic and real-world experiments for archaeological sites in Turkey, with up to only 4 iterations, we complete building footprints having only 10-15% of the ancient structure initially visible. We also compare to various state-of-the-art methods and show our superior quantitative/qualitative performance. While we show results for archaeology, we anticipate our method can be used for restoring highly incomplete historical sketches and for modern day urban reconstruction despite occlusions.;Zhang et al. - 2022 - Guided pluralistic building contour completion.txt

Many dental age and gender detection procedures have limitations, such as minimal accuracy and dependability. Gender identification techniques aren't well studied, despite the fact that classification effectiveness and accuracy are low. The suggested approach takes into account the shortcomings of the current system. Deep learning techniques can successfully resolve issues that occurred in other classifiers. Human gender and age identification is a crucial process in the fields of forensics, anthropology, and bio archeology. The image preparation and feature extraction process are accomplished by deep learning algorithms. The performance of classification is improved by minimizing the occurrence of loss with the assistance of a spike neuron-based convolutional neural network (SN-CNN).

This study emphasizes the need to understand that bone surface modifications are dynamic taphonomic entities subjected to context-dependent morphing processes. Every depiction of a mark is just time-determined. Here, we show through experiments that trampling affected mostly the presence and internal configuration of microstriations, as well as the flaking and the morphology of the shoulder of the mark. The presence of overlapping striae and microabrasion were reported as signatures of trampling which did not affect cut mark morphology. Sandy sediment was found more abrasive than gravel sediment because of its potential to get inside the grooves of marks and modify their walls more intensively. The moderate abrasion process modeled here did not impact cut marks to the point of not being differentiated from other types of marks. A comparison with trampling marks successfully classified both types of modifications.;Pizarro-Monzo et Dominguez-Rodrigo - 2020 - Dynamic modification of cut marks by trampling te.txt

Among their programs, OTF creates hands on learning opportunities for students and people interested in marine science, technology and education. This paper will describe opportunities and experiences of an undergraduate student, Jenna Carlson, from the University of Connecticut (UConn), who works closely with OTF in education and outreach coordination. These hands on learning opportunities and internships provide vital experiences to students like Jenna that will influence their career decisions in the future. For example, OTF and UConn in cooperation with Zoomarine, a marine park and education facility in the Algarve of Portugal, have established a study abroad internship program. Students are able to participate as interns and work closely with marine mammal trainers in all aspects of their daily jobs. As an intern, Jenna participated in training, medical procedures, feeding and daily maintenance of seven Bottlenose dolphins at Zoomarine. As another example, OTF sponsors a Science, Education and Marine Archeology Program in Portugal (SEMAPP). In April 2004 a SEMAPP expedition was conducted using the Delta submersible. Jenna assisted OTT with much of the planning and preparation for the expedition and played a critical role in carrying out education and outreach aspects of the program. This included working with Portuguese high school students on the research vessel, planning a daily schedule for the students, and creating hands-on learning activities. The experiences here created an exciting opportunity for Jenna, as she is the first U.S. undergraduate student to make a deep-sea dive in Portugal.

We present an unsupervised method for automatic feature extraction and classification of wheel-made vessels. A convolutional neural network was trained with a profile image database from Iberian wheel made pottery vessels found in the upper valley of the Guadalquivir River (Spain). During the design of the model, data augmentation and regularization techniques were implemented to obtain better generalization outcomes. The resulting model is able to provide classification on profile images automatically, with an accuracy mean score of 0.9013. Such computation methods will enhance and complement research on characterization and classification of pottery assemblages based on fragments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) advanced models have a higher capacity in extracting appropriate features compared to traditional models. In this paper, the ability and capacity of deep CNNs in automatic classification of two handwriting based demographical problems, i.e. gender and handedness classification, have been examined by using advanced CNNs; DenseNet201, InceptionV3, and Xception. Two databases, IAM (English texts) and KHATT (Arabic texts) have been employed in this study. The achieved results showed that the proposed CNNs architectures performed well in improving classification results, with 84% accuracy (1.27% improvement) for gender classification using the IAM database, and 99.14% accuracy (28.23% improvement) for handedness classification using the KHATT database.";Rahmanian et Shayegan - 2021 - Handwriting-based gender and handedness classifica.txt

Indeed, small and agile remotely controlled vehicles with cameras can be used to detect unexploded bombs in shallow waters, more effectively and freely than complex, costly and heavy equipment, requiring several human operators and support boats. Moreover, visual techniques can be easily combined with the traditional use of magnetometers and scanning imaging sonars, to improve the effectiveness of the survey. The proposed system can be easily adapted to other scenarios (e.g., underwater archeology or visual inspection of underwater pipelines and implants), by simply replacing the Convolutional Neural Network devoted to the visual identification task. As a final outcome of our work we provide a large dataset of images of explosive materials: it can be used to compare different visual techniques on a common basis.;Foresti_2022.txt

Furthermore, the control of fire allowed the development of the first symbolic behavior in deep caves, around 176 ky BP. These activities would increase during the Upper Paleolithic, when lighting residues proliferated at these sites. The physical peculiarities of Paleolithic lighting resources are very poorly understood, although this is a key aspect for the study of human activity within caves and other dark contexts. In this work, we characterize the main Paleolithic lighting systems (e.g., wooden torches, portable fat lamps, and fireplaces) through empirical observations and experimental archeology in an endokarstic context. Furthermore, each lighting system's characteristic combustion residues were identified to achieve a better identification for the archaeological record. The experiments are based on an exhaustive review of archaeological information about this topic.

The potential of the site has been evaluated through multidisciplinary research including taxonomy, anatomy, deep learning, and direct dating of fossil remains. A surface study carried out in 2017, over a very limited area (2 m(2)) on the slope of one of the Ruidera lakes led to the discovery of more than 50 fossil specimens, including cranial (mainly teeth) and postcranial remains. This rich assemblage is dominated by the remains of Caprinae, although the presence of some small or medium carnivore remains also stands out. The identification of a cut mark, tested with Convolutional Neural Networks, suggests the presence of human activity within the bone assemblage. Several fossils were directly dated using a multi-technique approach involving radiocarbon, U-Th, and ESR methods. The results constrain the fossil assemblage to between 300 ka and 400 ka, positioning Los Villares as one of the first Middle Pleistocene localities identified in the Upper Guadiana basin, on the Southern edge of the Southern Iberian Plateau. These promising initial results show the great potential of the site to contribute to filling a gap of knowledge in the Pleistocene archaeo-paleontological record of the Iberian Peninsula. Nevertheless, we also acknowledge the need for systematic excavations in the future, not only to obtain a better idea of the lateral and stratigraphic extension of the fossil assemblage and its complete taxonomic composition, but also to confirm the human presence at the site.;Garcia-Martinez_2022.txt

However, it remains unclear whether it can accurately detect historical buildings in RS imagery. Here we proposed a new deep transfer learning approach based on aerial photographs to automatically detect Hakka Weilong Houses (HWHs), a famous type of historical residence and an important cultural symbol of Hakka, a Han Chinese subgroup across the world. An RS image dataset, namely Hakka Weilong House Image Dataset (HWHID), was created by using aerial photographs of the urban and suburban Meizhou, which is called the world Hakka capital. The dataset was randomly shuffled into training and testing ones with a ratio of 8:2. Our approach used ResNet50 as the backbone transfer network and YOLO v2 as a training framework. Experimental results showed that the average precision was 0.9599 +/- 0.0150, the loss rate was 0.0250, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for training was 0.1580, and the average detecting time per image clip was 0.0383 +/- 0.0150 second, suggesting that our model has a high accuracy and an excellent performance for the HWH detection task.

Maps produced before the expansion of large-scale mechanized agriculture reflect a landscape that is lost today. Of particular interest to us is the great quantity of archaeologically relevant information that these maps recorded, both deliberately and incidentally. Despite the importance of the information they contain, researchers have only recently begun to automatically digitize and extract data from such maps as coherent information, rather than manually examine a raster image. However, these new approaches have focused on specific types of information that cannot be used directly for archaeological or heritage purposes. This paper provides a proof of concept of the application of deep learning techniques to extract archaeological information from historical maps in an automated manner. Early twentieth century colonial map series have been chosen, as they provide enough time depth to avoid many recent large-scale landscape modifications and cover very large areas (comprising several countries). The use of common symbology and conventions enhance the applicability of the method. The results show deep learning to be an efficient tool for the recovery of georeferenced, archaeologically relevant information that is represented as conventional signs, line-drawings and text in historical maps. The method can provide excellent results when an adequate training dataset has been gathered and is therefore at its best when applied to the large map series that can supply such information. The deep learning approaches described here open up the possibility to map sites and features across entire map series much more quickly and coherently than other available methods, opening up the potential to reconstruct archaeological landscapes at continental scales.;Garcia-Molsosa et al. - 2021 - Potential of deep learning segmentation for the ex.txt

Cut mark analysis, however, has been the root of great debates, with some authors claiming to have the oldest cut marks in or outside of Africa. If these marks were to truly be anthropic in nature, then the repercussions of these findings would produce a paradigm shift for our understanding of human evolution. Unfortunately, the majority of methods available for cut mark classification are namely qualitative in nature. Here we provide a new, highly powerful artificially intelligent neural network classification model that can be used to quantitatively and more objectively overcome these issues, using 3D digital microscopy, Deep Learning and Geometric Morphometrics to obtain up to 100% accuracy in some cases. Abstract The concept of equifinality is currently one of the largest issues in taphonomy, frequently leading analysts to erroneously interpret the formation and functionality of archaeological and paleontological sites. An example of this equifinality can be found in the differentiation between anthropic cut marks and other traces on bone produced by natural agents, such as that of sedimentary abrasion and trampling. These issues are a key component in the understanding of early human evolution, yet frequently rely on qualitative features for their identification. Unfortunately, qualitative data is commonly susceptible to subjectivity, producing insecurity in research through analyst experience. The present study intends to confront these issues through a hybrid methodological approach. Here, we combine Geometric Morphometric data, 3D digital microscopy, and Deep Learning Neural Networks to provide a means of empirically classifying taphonomic traces on bone. Results obtained are able to reach over 95% classification, providing a possible means of overcoming taphonomic equifinality in the archaeological and paleontological register.;Courtenay et al. - 2020 - A Hybrid Geometric Morphometric Deep Learning Appr.txt

Cultural Heritage around the globe suffers from wars, natural disasters and human negligence. The importance of digital documentation is well recognized and there is an increasing pressure to document our heritage both nationally and internationally. For this reason, the three-dimensional scanning and modeling of sites and artifacts of cultural heritage have remarkably increased in recent years. The semantic segmentation of point clouds is an essential step of the entire pipeline; in fact, it allows to decompose complex architectures in single elements, which are then enriched with meaningful information within Building Information Modelling software. Notwithstanding, this step is very time consuming and completely entrusted on the manual work of domain experts, far from being automatized. This work describes a method to label and cluster automatically a point cloud based on a supervised Deep Learning approach, using a state-of-the-art Neural Network called PointNet++. Despite other methods are known, we have choose PointNet++ as it reached significant results for classifying and segmenting 3D point clouds. PointNet++ has been tested and improved, by training the network with annotated point clouds coming from a real survey and to evaluate how performance changes according to the input training data. It can result of great interest for the research community dealing with the point cloud semantic segmentation, since it makes public a labelled dataset of CH elements for further tests.";Malinverni et al. - 2019 - DEEP LEARNING FOR SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION OF 3D POIN.txt

These amplitude maps are mainly used for data interpretation and provide a good insight into the subsurface but cannot fully describe it. The main limitations are discussed while studies aiming to overcome them are reviewed. These studies involve integrated interpretation approaches using both B-scans and C-scans, attribute analysis, fusion approaches, and recent attempts to automatically interpret C-scans using Deep Learning (DL) algorithms.

In the first step we used the deep learning network RetinaNet to detect hyperbola automatically and achieved an average precision of 0.58. In the next step, 10 different approaches for hyperbola fitting and thus velocity determination were applied. The derived information was validated with manually determined velocities and apex points. It was shown that hyperbola extraction by using a threshold and a column connection clustering (C3) algorithm followed by simple hyperbola fitting is the best method, which had a mean velocity error of 0.021 m/ns compared to manual determination.

Remote sensing fieldwork and post-processing application of Deep Learning methods by MEDS BV specialists, and subsequent analysis of DTM images by archaeologists yielded a remarkably detailed picture of a forest-covered, previously unstudied sector at the extensive archaeological complex of Kuelap called Imperio. At 3000 m above sea level, the Kuelap site complex consists of at least 12 sectors and two cliff cemeteries sprawling 900 hectares along a ridge top above the western banks of the Utcubamba River valley. Kuelap's centerpiece and featured tourist attraction called \La Fortaleza\"" is a large settlement built atop a massive walled platform a long, prominent ridgetop. The Kuelap complex was probably the most populous locality in the Utcubamba River valley and is attributed to peoples that the Inka and Spaniards called \""Chachapoya.\"" Early Spanish settlers left no known written descriptions of the site, nor useful descriptions regarding the region's inhabitants. Consequently- and despite extensive archaeological studies - important questions concerning the political, economic, and religious roles of Kuelap in the region remain unresolved. The project reported here has primary and secondary objectives, both resulting from multiple stages of data gathering, processing, analysis, and interpretation. The primary goal was to capture high-resolution, three-dimensional georeferenced imagery of archaeological remains hidden beneath the region's dense tropical montane forests and provide sufficient data for a rich preliminary description. This work responds to the urgent need to identify, characterize, and protect such cultural heritage from looting and destructive activities that accompany population growth and deforestation. The second objective emerged as an unexpected bonus, only because of the extraordinary success of the first. Successful imaging of surface details at Imperio provided an extraordinary opportunity to reevaluate previous interpretations of the site, and to offer an alternative novel hypothesis regarding Imperio's history of occupation and particularly the site's special functions. The imagery enabled identification of subtle surface features that we suggest could be overlooked and inadvertently destroyed during conventional ground-level mapping and documentation activities in such complex, overgrown terrain. Many such features are functional elements of a planned drainage system that warrants further study for long-term conservation planning.""";Righetti et al. - 2021 - Survey of a Peruvian Archaeological Site Using LiD.txt

Spatial interpretation of numerous objects with various shapes and sizes is a difficult challenge for archaeologists. Mapping structures with multiple elements whose area can exceed dozens of hectares, such as ancient agricultural field systems, is very time-consuming. These archaeological sites are composed of a large number of embanked fields, which together form a recognizable spatial pattern. Image classification and segmentation, as well as object recognition, are the most important tasks for deep learning neural networks (DLNN) and therefore they can be used for automatic recognition of archaeological monuments. In this study, a U-Net neural network was implemented to perform semantic segmentation of the ALS-derived data including (1) archaeological, (2) natural and (3) modern features in the Polish part of the Bialowieza Forest. The performance of the U-Net segmentation model was evaluated by measuring the pixel-wise similarity between ground truth and predicted segmentation masks.

Second, vegetation-index segmentation methods from satellites require manual thresholding, which varies across geographic areas, and are not robust across cities with varying terrain, geometry, altitude, and canopy. In our work, we compensate for the lack of visual detail by using satellite snapshots across twelve months and segment cities into various vegetation clusters. Then, we use multiple GAN-based networks to plant trees by recognizing placement patterns inside segmented regions procedurally.

One reflection of this is the carnivore modification of hominin bones. During human evolution, hominins were first prey and then predators of other animals, including carnivores. Modifications reported on some hominin bones could result from primary predators feeding on them or post-depositional modifications by scavengers. Determining carnivore agency would be crucial to interpret such information. Here, a series of computer vision models based on convolutional neural networks is presented, comparing five different types of carnivores jointly and then pairwise. It is shown how such models contain different heuristics regarding specific carnivore taxa, which regarding tooth marks made by lions and spotted hyenas can be accurately classified by as much as 92% of the testing set. The present study also shows the potential of transfer knowledge in building accurate classification of images and for taphonomic interpretation. The application to tooth marking on a 500 ka hominin femoral shaft indicates that by that time, carnivore modifications of human remains may have resulted from post-depositional scavenging rather than by predation.;Abellan et al. - 2021 - Deep learning classification of tooth scores made .txt

Distinctive geometric patterns are typical for specific periods, regions, workshops as well as painters and are an important cue for archaeological tasks, such as dating and attribution. To date, these analyses are mostly conducted with the support of information technology. The primitives of an artefact's ornamentation can be generally classified into a set of distinguishable pattern classes, which also appear in a similar fashion on other objects. Although a taxonomy of known pattern classes is given in subject-specific publications, the automatic detection and classification of surface patterns from object depictions poses a non-trivial challenge. Our long-term goal is to provide this classification functionality using a specifically designed and trained neural network. This, however, requires a large amount of labelled training data, which at this point does not exist for this domain context. In this work, we propose an effective annotation system, which allows a domain expert to interactively segment and label parts of digitized vessel surfaces. These user inputs are constantly fed back to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), enabling the prediction of pattern classes for a given surface area with ever increasing precision. Our work paves the way for a fully automatic classification and analysis of large surface pattern collections, which, with the help of suitable visual analysis techniques, can answer research questions like pattern variability or change over time. While the capability of our proposed annotation pipeline is demonstrated at the example of two characteristic Greek pottery artefacts from the Geometric period, the proposed methods can be readily adopted for the patternation in any other chronological periods as well as for stamped motifs.;Lengauer_2022.txt

Based on a deep-learning technique for post-mortem interval approach (ranging from 1 day up to 2000 years) an estimation of post-mortem interval with an accuracy of almost 100% in bones is possible. Estimating the post-mortem interval (PMI) of human skeletal remains is a critical issue of forensic analysis, with important limitations such as sample preparation and practicability. In this work, NIR spectroscopy (NIRONE (R) Sensor X; Spectral Engines, 61449, Germany) was applied to estimate the PMI of 104 human bone samples between 1 day and 2000 years. Reflectance data were repeatedly collected from eight independent spectrometers between 1950 and 1550 nm with a spectral resolution of 14 nm and a step size of 2 nm, each from the external and internal bone. An Artificial Neural Network was used to analyze the 66,560 distinct diagnostic spectra, and clearly distinguished between forensic and archaeological bone material: the classification accuracies for PMIs of 0-2 weeks, 2 weeks-6 months, 6 months-1 year, 1 year-10 years, and >100 years were 0.90, 0.94, 0.94, 0.93, and 1.00, respectively. PMI of archaeological bones could be determined with an accuracy of 100%, demonstrating the adequate predictive performance of the model. Applying a handheld NIR spectrometer to estimate the PMI of human skeletal remains is rapid and extends the repertoire of forensic analyses as a distinct, novel approach.";Schmidt et al. - 2022 - Post-Mortem Interval of Human Skeletal Remains Est.txt

Deep neural models have been able to perform image-to-image translation by transferring pictorial styles, coloring old photographs or filling in missing parts. This last technique is known as image inpainting and enables restoration of damaged or missing parts of an image or photograph to obtain the complete picture. However, it is not always possible to properly define which parts are missing or to identify where they are missing, as in the case of superimposing new information on an already complete image. In this paper, we propose the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs), a well-known deep learning model, for virtual inpainting restoration of artificial landscape images containing archaeological remains of Greek temples. The network identifies key features determined by the internal logic of the architectural style denoted by the ruins and adds the missing architectural elements to obtain an image of the restored building. Unlike other studies, it does not receive any information on which elements should be added or where. Virtual inpainting restoration is capable of representing a building's envelope but also integrates particular aspects of the building related to the architectural language used for its design. The restoration of the fundamental parts of the classical Greek order was consistent, and the results were evaluated with objective metrics and through a subjective survey between academics and architects. They showed that adding segmented images to the training dataset gives better results.;Nogales et al. - 2021 - ARQGAN An evaluation of generative adversarial ne.txt

Acquiring and tagging point clouds is more expensive and tedious labour than its image equivalent process. Point cloud online datasets contain few samples for Deep Learning or not always the desired classes This work focuses on minimizing the use of point cloud samples for neural network training in urban object classification. The method proposed is based on the conversion of point clouds to images (pc-images) because it enables: the use of Convolutional Neural Networks, the generation of several samples (images) per object (point clouds) by means of multi-view, and the combination of pc-images with images from online datasets (ImageNet and Google Images). The study is conducted with ten classes of objects extracted from two street point clouds from two different cities. The network selected for the job is the InceptionV3. The training set consists of 5000 online images with a variable percentage (0% to 10%) of pc-images. The validation and testing sets are composed exclusively of pc-images. Although the network trained only with online images reached 47% accuracy, the inclusion of a small percentage of pc-images in the training set improves the classification to 99.5% accuracy with 6% pc-images. The network is also applied at IQmulus & TerraMobilita Contest dataset and it allows the correct classification of elements with few samples.;j.autcon.2019.103058.txt

As it stands, healing ways of knowing that depend on medicinal plants, the Earth's elements, and knowledge of the stars are still intact. The Indigenous Xicana/o/xs who belong to many of the mobile tribes of Mesoamerica share a long genealogical history of cultivating and sustaining their Native American rituals, which was weakened in Mexico and the United States during various periods of colonization. This special edition essay sheds light on the story of Quetzalcoatl and the Venus Star as a familial place of Xicana/o/x belonging and practice. To do so, we rely on the archaeological interpretation of these two entities as one may get to know them through artifacts, monuments, and ethnographic accounts, of which some date to Mesoamerica's Formative period (1500-400 BC). Throughout this paper, ancestral medicine ways are shown to help cultivate positive health, learning, and community. Such cosmic knowledge is poorly understood, yet it may further culturally relevant education and the treatment of the rampant health disparities in communities of Mesoamerican ancestry living in the United States. The values of and insights into Indigenous Xicana/o/x knowledge and identity conclude this essay.;Garcia et Marquez - 2021 - Cultivating Positive Health, Learning, and Communi.txt

Furthermore, vision-based approaches can cause errors, considering the complex types of de-terioration that develop in different scales and forms in monuments. This problem can be solved effec-tively owing to computer vision algorithms, commonly used in different areas nowadays. This study aims to develop a model that automatically detects and maps deteriorations (biological colonization, contour scaling, crack, higher plant, impact damage, microkarst, missing part) and restoration interventions using the Mask R-CNN algorithm, which has recently come to the fore with its feature of recognizing small and large-sized objects. To this end, a total of 2460 images of Yazilikaya monuments in the Hattusa archeo-logical site, which is on the UNESCO heritage list, were gathered. In the training phase of the proposed method, it was trained in model 1 to distinguish deposit deterioration commonly observed on the surface of monuments from other anomalies. Other anomalies trained were model 2. In this phase of the models, the average precision values with high accuracy rates ranging from 89.624% to 100% were obtained for the deterioration classes. The developed algorithms were tested on 4 different rock reliefs in Yazilikaya, which were not used in the training phase. In addition, an image of the Eflatunpinar water monument, which is on the UNESCO tentative list, was used to test the model's universality. According to the test results, it was determined that the models could be successfully applied to obtain maps of deterioration and restoration interventions in monuments in different regions.

Simple, deterministic relationships between environmental stress and social change are inadequate. Extreme drought, for instance, triggered both social collapse and ingenious management of water through irrigation. Human responses to change, in turn, feed into climate and ecological systems, producing a complex web of multidirectional connections in time and space. Integrated records of the co-evolving human-environment system over millennia are needed to provide a basis for a deeper understanding of the present and for forecasting the future. This requires the major task of assembling and integrating regional and global historical, archaeological, and paleoenvironmental records. Humans cannot predict the future.

Values of delta O-18 were measured in as many as sixty 10-mu m spots along 2-3 mm transects from the otolith core to its margin with high spot-to-spot analytical precision (delta O-18 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand). We obtained sample densities along a linear transect that were at least 2 to 3 times greater than micromilling/conventional mass spectrometry techniques. From modern Pacific cod otoliths (using in situ temperatures from electronic archive tags) we calibrated an empirical fractionation equation of aragonite delta O-18 to sea water temperature (r(2) = 0.75, p < 0.001, delta O-18(A) = 2.13-0.25 T degrees C) and from which we predicted the thermography of fish life history and historic nearshore water temperature in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Sinuous variability of delta O-18 values along core-to-margin transects likely reflect seasonal temperature changes and suggest similar longevity between modern and archaeological cod. Generally increasing delta O-18 values from the otolith core region to the margin revealed an ontogenetic migration from warmer nearshore habitat during the first year of life to cooler deeper waters at later ages, a behavior that has not changed over the past 200 years. A decline in the average delta O-18 of otolith cores from archaeological (similar to 200 +, similar to 100 + years before present, YBP) to modern otoliths suggest increasing sea surface temperatures from the late Little Ice Age to present. Temperatures calculated from the delta O-18 in aragonite suggest a 2-3 degrees C rise in coastal marine sea surface temperatures in the GOA over the last 200 years. Implications of indigenous subsistence resource use and settlement patterns are discussed in light of major shifts in GOA water temperatures and biological regimes.;Helser et al. - 2018 - A 200-year archaeozoological record of Pacific cod.txt

The objective is to create automated methods for automatically classifying and successively retrieving photographic data leveraging the current breed of AI methods based on Deep Learning paradigm. In this work, the lack of images to be used for the training of the AI system is addressed by testing an approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for automatically synthesizing unrealistic photos, which, in turn, can be used for training image classification and retrieval systems. Specifically, we propose a method to drive the generation of realistic classical order images using GAN approaches anchored to semantic ontology domain representation. More specifically, the proposed AI leverages the advantages of knowledge-based and data-driven methods and foresees a level image generation: the first one that synthesizes isolated objects corresponding to each ontology concept and the second one that, instead, combines the generated objects according to the spatial information provided by the ontology in order to generate realistic scenes. The resulting images can then be employed to train automated classifiers and more reliable retrieval methods by minimizing the efforts usually required by human operators to manually annotate data. In addition, the proposed generative strategy allows for a deeper understanding of cultural heritage visual data enabling the possibility to enhance design capabilities in simulation contexts.;Garozzo et al. - 2021 - Knowledge-based generative adversarial networks fo.txt
TUI97VR6;journalArticle;2019;"Merritt, SR; Peters, KD";The impact of flake tool attributes and butcher experience on carcass processing time and efficiency during experimental butchery trials;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OSTEOARCHAEOLOGY;Butchery involves using tools to process animal carcasses during consumption of tissue packages, and this technological adaptation has a deep connection with evolving human dietary ecology. Studying butchery informs archaeological inferences about lithic artefact function and site formation and describes skeletal traces of carcass consumption, which may corroborate the butchery function of certain tools. Diverse methodologies including subjective personal observations and well-controlled experiments that investigate abstracted slicing mechanics or realistic butchery scenarios provide mixed conclusions about which kinds of tools are more efficient for butchery and whether their archaeological traces can be discriminated. Much less analytical attention is devoted to investigating whether a butcher's experience using stone tools to process carcasses impacts their performance, which may confound experimental assessment of how tool attributes are related to butchery efficiency. These experiments examine butchery performance in two novices over 40 goat forelimb and hindlimb trials where a single flake was used to deflesh and disarticulate a limb. By measuring butchery performance as defleshing efficiency (the amount of meat removed per second) and the time necessary to disarticulate limb elements, we demonstrate that in general, both butchers performed similarly when butchering forelimbs and hindlimbs and did not exhibit a strong learning curve of performance improvement. As well, flake weight, size, and cutting edge length were positively related to defleshing efficiency and negatively related to disarticulation time, suggesting that larger flakes are better butchery tools. Our results suggest that anatomical differences between forelimbs and hindlimbs did not impact butchery timing or efficiency and butchery performance is similar across novices. To maximize comparability of experimental butchery results, we encourage future research to examine butchery performance with respect to animal or tissue package size and investigate how butcher experience impacts performance.;oa.2730.txt

Some selected areas are mapped well, while the majority of areas only contain chance discoveries, often with bad positional accuracy. The goal of this research was to develop automated tools for improving the cultural heritage mapping in Norway, thus enabling detailed mapping of large areas within realistic budgets and time frames. The focus was on three types of cultural heritage that occur frequently in many types of Norwegian landscape: grave mounds, pitfall traps in deer hunting systems and charcoal kilns. A recent development in deep neural networks for object detection in natural images is the region-proposing convolutional neural network (R-CNN), which may also be used for cultural heritage detection in local relief model (LRM) visualizations of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Python code for 'Simple Faster R-CNN' was downloaded from Github. On 737 test images (16.6 km(2)) not seen during training, 87 % of the true cultural heritage objects were correctly identified, while 24 % of the predicted cultural heritage locations were false. However, all test images were small (150 m x 150 m) and contained at least one cultural heritage object, meaning that the false positive rate may be higher for an entire landscape. In Larvik municipality, Vestfold and Telemark County, on a 67 km(2) area not seen during training, the R-CNN correctly identified 38 % of the true grave mounds, with 89 % false positives. On a 937 km(2) area covering Ovre Eiker municipality, Viken County, the R-CNN correctly identified 90 % of the charcoal kilns, with 38 % false positives. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Faster R-CNN is well suited for semi-automatic detection of cultural heritage objects such as charcoal kilns, grave mounds and pitfall traps in high resolution airborne lidar data. However, it is desirable to reduce the false positive rate in order to limit the amount of visual inspection needed when the method is applied to large areas for detailed archaeological mapping.;Trier et al. - 2021 - Automated mapping of cultural heritage in Norway f.txt

Current archaeological research on cultigens emphasizes the protracted and intimate human interactions with wild species that defined paths to domestication and, with certain plants, profoundly impacted humanity. Tobacco arguably has had more impact on global patterns in history than any other psychoactive substance, but how deep its cultural ties extend has been widely debated. Excavations at the Wishbone site, directed at the hearth-side activities of the early inhabitants of North America's desert west, have uncovered evidence for human tobacco use approximately 12,300 years ago, 9,000 years earlier than previously documented. Here we detail the preservation context of the site, discuss its cultural affiliation and suggest ways that the tobacco may have been used.

In this article, we examine contemporary engagement with rock art by the Yanyuwa Aboriginal community in northern Australia's southwest Gulf of Carpentaria region using relational and affectual experiences to highlight how rock art is rendered multivocal, sentient, and an active social agent in the present. We argue that, by focusing on the wider social context of rock art, such as the networks of relationships that images are embedded within and the powerful affective nature of motifs, researchers are better placed to examine rock art in a holistic sense while also considering notions of change, continuity, and relevance in relation to visual heritage.;684683.txt

Fortunately, low-resolution grayscale infrared images of the Palestinian Archaeological Museum plates holding the scrolls in their discovered state are extant, along with recent high-quality multispectral images by the Israel Antiquities Authority. However, the necessary task of identifying each fragment in the new images on the old plates is tedious and time consuming to perform manually, and is often problematic when fragments have been moved from the original plate. We describe an automated system that segments the new and old images of fragments from the background on which they were imaged, finds their matches on the old plates and aligns and superimposes them. To this end, we developed a deep-learning based segmentation method and a cascade approach for template matching, based on scale, shape analysis and dense matching. We have tested the proposed method on five plates, comprising about 120 fragments. We present both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the results and perform an ablation study to evaluate the importance of each component of our system.;WACV.2018.00029.txt

Materials: 3232 well-preserved tubular bones representing an MNI of 250 human adults. Methods: Each bone was visually inspected. Measurements were taken with an osteometric board, sliding calipers, and a flexible tape measure. Results: Of 1210 metapodials excavated from eight burial contexts, ten were atypically short. Conclusions: The ten shortened elements represent an MNI of three individuals with brachydactyly from two tombs. The presence of at least two individuals with brachydactyly in one tomb adds support to a previous suggestion that tombs were used for familial interment. It is plausible that the third individual from a different tomb was related to the other two, and the different burial contexts may reflect postmarital practices. Significance: These cases offer insight into tomb use and underscore the importance of identifying rare developmental anomalies in the archaeological record as their presence may indicate genetic relationships within or among archaeological cemeteries. Limitations: With commingled contexts and incomplete recovery of skeletal remains, individualizing the brachydactylous elements was not possible. There is also a lack of comparative data from other Andean sites. Suggestions for Further Research: Identify more Andean cases of brachydactyly to learn if the relatively frequent involvement of the first digit is more common among Andean skeletal samples than North American, or if it is unique to Marcajirca.;j.ijpp.2021.04.006.txt

Nowadays, web platforms play host to groups dedicated to illegal archaeological excavations and Illicit trade of cultural goods. Looters have the freedom to connect online with potential buyers around the world. At the same time, social media platform monitoring in search of criminal activities conducted by LEAs is poor due to the lack of expertise, efficient tools to scan the massive amounts of data, and funds.

Safeguarding heritage is also valued highly in the priorities of the European Commission. As a result, there have been several long-term initiatives involving the digitisation, annotation and cataloguing of tangible cultural heritage in museums and collections. Specifically, for built heritage, a pressing challenge is that historical monuments such as buildings, temples, churches or city fortification infrastructures are hard to document due to their historic palimpsest; spatial transformations, actions of destruction, reuse of material, or continuous urban development that covers traces and changes the formal integrity and identity of a cultural heritage site. The ability to reason about a monument's form is crucial for efficient documentation and cataloguing. This paper presents a 3D digitisation workflow through the involvement of reality capture technologies for the annotation and structure analysis of built heritage with the use of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) for classification purposes. The presented workflow contributes a new approach to the identification of a building's architectural components (e.g., arch, dome) and to the study of the stylistic influences (e.g., Gothic, Byzantine) of building parts. In doing so this workflow can assist in tracking a building's history, identifying its construction period and comparing it to other buildings of the same period.

At the same time, we are in the midst of an international project with the goal of designing and building algorithmic tools that will relate the different images of scroll fragments with each other and with their textual transcriptions. As part of this effort, we are in the process of incorporating a deep-learning based segmentation method into the pipeline, which will allow one to manipulate images of the individual fragments themselves. Previous segmentation efforts succeeded in removing most of the shadows from the older images but failed to remove from the foreground of the new images those parts that show the Japanese tissue paper used by conservators to strengthen the edges of the fragment and hold it in place. We solve the problem of identifying and removing the tissue from the segmented images. This advance dramatically improves the effectiveness of our matching algorithms for searching among the old plates for the location of the newly-digitized fragments. In particular, the improved matching has allowed us to locate two fragments whose positions on the old plates were not recorded. The matching algorithm is being incorporated in the new platform and will begin serving scroll scholars in the near future.;badamdorj_2018.txt

This paper deals with the reconstruction of realistic 3D models of buildings facades, in the urban environment for cultural heritage. The proposed approach is an extension of our previous work in this research topic, which introduced a methodology for accurate 3D realistic facade reconstruction by defining and exploiting a relation between stereoscopic image and tacheometry data. In this work, we re-purpose well known deep neural network architectures in the fields of image segmentation and single image depth prediction, for the tasks of facade structural element detection, depth point-cloud generation and protrusion estimation, with the goal of alleviating drawbacks in our previous design, resulting in a more light-weight, robust, flexible and cost-effective design.;Bacharidis et al. - 2020 - 3D Building Facade Reconstruction Using Deep Learn.txt

The diffusion o f new technologies, including low-cost sensors and devices, has introduced many possibilities and strategies to monitor environments, including Historical and Cultural value buildings. Based on the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, modern devices and sensors can collect and manage helpful information to build a Digital Twin of the surrounding environment. In this scenario, reproducing a Digital Twin of Cultural Heritage Buildings could be crucial to monitoring, managing, and performing action aiming to protect them. One of the challenges in recent years is the automatic analysis of collected information. This paper introduces a novel approach to protecting Buildings using Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM), which leverages a sensor network and Deep Learning techniques to analyze sensor data. A case study related to the Archeological Park of Pompeii will be presented, where real-time collected data is managed and shared via a web-cloud-IoT platform. Then, collected data are analyzed through a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to prevent future issues related to Cultural Heritage Buildings, particularly humidity inside structures, which is crucial for ancient building preservation.;NA

The method sets up a new target for deep-learning, integrating information from points along inner and outer surfaces to learn about shapes. Training the classifiers required tackling multiple challenges that arose on account of our working with real-world archeological data: paucity of labeled data; extreme imbalance between instances of different categories; and the need to avoid neglecting rare classes and to take note of minute distinguishing features of some classes. The scarcity of training data was overcome by using synthetically-produced virtual potsherds and by employing multiple data-augmentation techniques. A novel form of training loss allowed us to overcome classification problems caused by under-populated classes and inhomogeneous distribution of discriminative features.";Itkin_2021.txt
KY3JHNP6;journalArticle;2019;Lieberman, P;The antiquity and evolution of the neural bases of rhythmic activity;ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES;The evolution of the anatomy and neural circuits that regulate the rhythm of speech can be traced back to the Devonian age, 400 million years ago. Epigenetic processes 100 million years later modified these circuits. Natural selection on similar genetic processes occurred during the evolution of archaic hominins and humans. The lungs and larynx-anatomy that produces the rhythmic fundamental frequency patterns of speech-have a deep evolutionary history. Neural circuits linking the cortex, basal ganglia, and other subcortical structures plan, sequence, and execute motor as well as cognitive acts. These neural circuits generate the rhythm of speech, singing, and chanting. The human form of the transcription factor FOXP2 increased synaptic connectivity and plasticity in basal ganglia circuits, enhancing motor control and cognitive and linguistic capabilities in humans as well as Neanderthals. The archeological record also suggests that Neanderthals passed spoken language. Homologous circuits existed in amphibians. In songbirds, the avian form of FOXP2 acted on similar neural circuits allowing birds to learn and produce new songs. Current studies point to natural selection on genetic events enhancing these and other neural circuits to yield fully human rhythmic speech, and motor, cognitive, and linguistic capabilities, rather than the saltation proposed by Noam Chomsky.;nyas.14199.txt

In this study, we carried out a comprehensive study of chronology, absolute and relative paleointensity on a late Neolithic site in central China. Ages of the samples are constrained to be similar to 3,500-3,000 BCE, a period when available paleointensity data are sparse. We present a total of 64 high-fidelity absolute paleointensities, demonstrating the field varied quickly from similar to 55 to similar to 90 ZAm(2) between similar to 3,500-3,000 BCE. Our results record a new archeomagnetic jerk around 3,300 BCE, which is probably non-dipolar origin. The new results provide robust constraints on global geomagnetic models. We calculated a revised Chinese archeointensity reference curve for future application. The variations of absolute and relative paleointensity versus depth show good consistency, reinforcing the reliability of our results. This new attempt of combining absolute and relative paleointenstiy provides a useful tool for future archeomagnetic research. Plain Language Summary The geomagnetic field is generated in the Earth's liquid outer core; its behavior can provide us information on the Earth's interior and help us understand processes deep in the planet we live on. The magnetic field surrounds the Earth and acts like an umbrella protecting the planet from strong solar winds, and thus the geomagnetic behavior can affect life on the Earth. Understanding the evolution of the geomagnetic field allows us to learn about the Earth in the past and can help us predict what will happen in the future. The geomagnetic field includes both dipolar and non-dipolar components, with the former related to global and the latter to regional features. Studying regional geomagnetic variations from different areas is essential for outlining regional features and global distributions of the field. In this study, we carried out archeomagnetic research on a late Neolithic archeological site in central China. The high-fidelity results fill a gap of the present data set in both space and time, and thus refine both the regional and global geomagnetic models significantly. The newly released Chinese archeointensity reference curve in this study can be used for regional geomagnetic comparison as well as for archeological dating in this region.";Cai et al. - 2020 - High-Fidelity Archeointensity Results for the Late.txt

Considering the fundamental transformation in human behavior that occurred during the Acheulo-Yabrudian complex, which includes the use of habitual fire and the intensive use of predetermined blank technology among the emergence of other traits, it is of significance whether these transformations continued in the Levant from the Lower Paleolithic to the Middle Paleolithic or whether they were completely swept away by a new wave of humans bringing with them similar as well as different sets of behaviours. This question can be best elucidated through a search of continuity in technological choices which can reflect socially-learned traditions of stone knapping. Our study is carried out on the long 16 m deep archeological sequence of Tabun Cave, by combining results from Ronen's and Jelinek's excavations, which comprise ca. 100 superimposed layers, ranging from the Lower to the Middle Paleolithic. An overview of various reduction sequences, i.e., the Yabrudian scraper-blank production, the blade production of the Amudian, the exploitation of various types of cores on flakes, the variable exploitation of handaxes as cores and the Levallois technology at the site, indicates that although the Acheulo-Yabrudian and the Levantine Mousterian complexes exhibit marked differences in the macro level, there are also some significant features of similarity in the micro level, as reflected in particular technological choices within the reduction sequences that suggest some continuity in technological tradition. Exploring all ranges of reduction sequences can also provide new insights regarding the development of Levallois technology that burst at the Middle Paleolithic and demonstrate how particular technological choices that were already embedded in the knapping tradition of the Acheulo-Yabrudian are manifested in the particular method of Levallois that characterize the Mousterian of Tabun Cave.

I analyze feminized artificial intelligence (Siri, Alexa, Cortana) in light of two science-fiction narratives: Tomorrow's Eve, a Victorian novel; and Her, a postmillennial film. Each story exemplifies a pivotal moment in media history: Eve the transition from symbolic to technical media; Her the transition from technical to computational media. Both stories depict a man falling in love with an artificially intelligent, feminized version of the communication media du jour. Whereas Eve and Her operate on our imaginary, Siri, Alexa, and Cortana are by our side every day, naturalizing contingent gender divisions. I address three questions: what is the cultural work accomplished by feminized AI? Which boundaries are coming down or built up? What gendered relations are (re)produced? Drawing on media archaeology, critical theory, gender studies, and media theory, this article argues the association of femininity with technology sustains differences across three dimensions: docile labour, replaceable embodiment, and artificial intelligence. This triadic framework weaves together analytic threads that often remain separate to develop a nuanced critique of femininity as a mode for domesticating new technology and technology as materializing gender relations. The discussion extends the framework to a more generalized analysis of AI as a problematic prescription for how we become machine-shaped. I advance an entangled reinterpretation of the Turing Test and suggest ethics, aesthetics, and performativity as key sites of intervention in rethinking AI design to include rather than exclude multiple forms of difference. The conclusion offers the framework as a novel heuristic for intersectional, nonreductive critiques of technology and difference.";09502386.2019.1671469.txt

An artificial intelligence approach;MEDITERRANEAN ARCHAEOLOGY & ARCHAEOMETRY;"Why archaeological artefacts are the way they are? In this paper we try to solve such a question by investigating the relationship between form and function. We propose new ways of studying the way behaviour in the past can be asserted on the examination of archaeological observables in the present. In any case, we take into account that there are also non-visual features characterizing ancient objects and materials (i.e., compositional information based on mass spectrometry data, chronological information based on radioactive decay measurements, etc.). Information that should make us aware of many functional properties of objects is multidimensional in nature: size, which makes reference to height, length, depth, weight and mass; shape and form, which make reference to the geometry of contours and volumes; texture, which refers to the microtopography (roughness, waviness, and lay) and visual appearance (colour variations, brightness, reflectivity and transparency) of surfaces; and finally material, meaning the combining of distinct compositional elements and properties to form a whole. With the exception of material data, the other relevant aspects for functional reasoning have been traditionally described in rather ambiguous terms, without taking into account the advantages of quantitative measurements of shape/form, and texture. Reasoning about the functionality of archaeological objects recovered at the archaeological site requires a cross-disciplinary investigation, which may also range from recognition techniques used in computer vision and robotics to reasoning, representation, and learning methods in artificial intelligence. The approach we adopt here is to follow current computational theories of object perception to ameliorate the way archaeology can deal with the explanation of human behaviour in the past (function) from the analysis of visual and non-visual data, taking into account that visual appearances and even compositional characteristics only constrain the way an object may be used, but never fully determine it.";Barcelo et de Almeida - 2012 - Functional analysis from visual and non-visual dat.txt

Using mathematical, physical, and artificial intelligence methods, some researchers in computational biology focused on uncovering the evolutionary ages of proteins according to present PPI networks (PINs), but improving their accuracy was challenging. A plausible explanation is that they solved biological problems with non-biological techniques and did not provide much attention to biological backgrounds and meanings of proteins or their relationships. In this paper, we propose two ways to improve the accuracy of age predicting and skillfully \embedding\"" multi source biological information in each iteration of an archaeology algorithm for yeast PIN. On the one hand, we reduce the probability of reversing errors by decreasing the non-duplication protein pairs, which are obtained from 460 gene trees constructed by means of a multiple sequence alignment and the neighbor joining algorithm. On the other hand, the reliable crossover standard from different biological information sources can decrease local random errors of alternative treatment. The application of the novel algorithm to simulation data and real yeast PINs shows a marked improvement in accuracy.

This article presents an archaeo-historic epidemiological modelling study of Rift Valley fever (RVF), using data-driven neural network technology. RVF affects both human and animal populations, can rapidly decimate herds causing catastrophic economic hardship, and is identified as a Category A biodefense pathogen by the US Center for Disease Control. Despite recent origins circa the early 1900s, little is known about the circumstances of its inception nor the relationships between factors that affect transmission. This evidence could be vital as the disease continues to expand from its epicentre in Kenya to other parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. RVF is a relevant case for archaeological/palaeopathological investigations of disease as it intersects between numerous human, animal, spatial, temporal, and sociopolitical dimensions. By integrating landscape archaeology, historical evidence, and climatic data, with evidence of human behaviour gathered through ethnoarchaeological study, this article presents an applied framework for human-animal palaeopathology. This framework aligns with the One Health approach that observes disease to be intrinsically tied to ecological and societal factors. We provide a useable alternative way of thinking about disease modelling in the present and the past, ultimately seeking to support efforts to accurately predict future impacts. Tapping into longitudinal evidence from the last 50-300 years offers a powerful way to respond to the threat zoonoses will pose to human populations around the world as the climate warms.;oa.2862.txt

Caustics result in changes in illumination that are continuous in nature; therefore, the first network is trained to produce a classification of caustics that is represented as a saliency map of the likelihood of caustics occurring at a pixel. In applications where caustic removal is essential, the second network is trained to generate a caustic-free image. It is extremely hard to generate real ground truth for caustics. We demonstrate how synthetic caustic data can be used for training in such cases, and then transfer the learning to real data. To the best of our knowledge, out of the handful of techniques that have been proposed, this is the first time that the complex problem of caustic removal has been reformulated and addressed as a classification and learning problem.

4B6RNNYG;journalArticle;2000;"O'Sullivan, D; Haklay, M";Agent-based models and individualism: is the world agent-based?;ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE;Agent-based models (ABMs) are an increasingly popular tool in the social sciences. This trend seems likely to continue, so that they will become widely used in geography and in urban and regional planning. We present an overview of examples of these models in the life sciences, economics, planning, sociology, and archaeology. We conclude that ABMs strongly tend towards an individualist view of the social world. This point is reinforced by closer consideration of particular examples. This discussion pays attention to the inadequacy of an individualist model of society with reference to debates in social theory. We argue that because models are closed representations of an open world it is important that institutions and other social structures be explicitly included, or that their omission be explained. A tentative explanation for the bias of ABMs is offered, based on an examination of early research in artificial intelligence and distributed artificial intelligence from which disciplines the approach is derived. Some implications of these findings are discussed. We indicate some useful research directions which are beginning to tackle the individualism issue directly. We further note that the underlying assumptions of ABMs are often hidden in the implementation details. We conclude that such models must be subject to critical examination of their assumptions, and that model builders should engage with social theory if the approach is to realise its full potential.;O'Sullivan et Haklay - 2000 - Agent-based models and individualism is the world.txt
J2AT5F5I;journalArticle;2018;Cirkovic, MM;Astroengineering, Dysonian SETI, and naturalism: A new Catch-22;ACTA ASTRONAUTICA;"A methodological problem is inherent in any discussion of extraterrestrial engineering and its detectability: how to distinguish detection signatures of such astroengineering from \natural\"", non-intentional, albeit exotic, processes? In practice, searches for traces and manifestations of advanced technological civilizations have been reduced so far to searching for outliers in the allegedly well-known regularities expected from natural astrophysical sources. This procedure, however, is an epistemological minefield, for at least two reasons: (i) prior datasets on which the regularities are based might be contaminated by artefacts, and (ii) the procedure of computation of unobservable quantities usually contains the implicit assumption of the non-intentional nature of sources. In other words, we are facing a Catch-22-type problem: in order to prove the artificial nature of a source, we seemingly need to first assume that it is not artificial. In contrast to most problems in science, this one could possibly be aggravated, rather than reduced, with the progress of our scientific understanding. Some possible recourses, as well as directions for further work toward building a comprehensive methodology of the Dysonian SETI, are discussed.""";j.actaastro.2018.07.051.txt

Due to the peculiarities of underwater archaeological surveys, the knowledge about the studied items is both provided by underwater archaeology and photogrammetry measures. The preservation and archival of this knowledge corresponds to one of the most important issues of this project. In order to efficiently handle these operations and to support sound and complete reasoning procedures an appropriate formal representation of underwater surveys is required. The exploration of artificial intelligence methods and tools motivated us to adopt an ontology-based solution. This paper presents our application ontology which takes into account a task ontology involving photogrammetry and an underwater archaeological domain ontology. For interoperability reasons, we then propose a mapping of this ontology on to the ISO International Standard CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model.;icsc.2010.104.txt
3FL5JMV2;journalArticle;2006;Zimmermann, HJ;Knowledge management, knowledge discovery, and dynamic intelligent data mining;CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS;During the last two to three decades, many scientific as well business areas have moved from a situation of a lack of (electronically) readable information into a situation of abundant data. Data warehouses appeared, and the problem of extracting information from large masses of data became more and more important. Also knowledge became a very precious commodity, and its efficient use often makes the difference between success and failure. Finding useful information or patterns in raw data is known in the literature under various names, such as knowledge discovery in data bases, data mining, knowledge extraction, information discovery, information harvesting, data archaeology, etc. Many research areas, such as machine learning, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, knowledge acquisition for expert systems, data visualization, and others are concerned with these activities, and the terminology used is not unequivocally defined. In this article, we shall first consider the different interpretations of the notions previously mentioned, and we shall then describe in more detail a recent technology that is very useful for data mining as well as for related areas.;01969720600734412.txt
FSZWPYKV;journalArticle;2008;Moise, G;A formal description of the systemic theory based e-learning;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL;This paper aims at presenting the systems theory-based approach to the learning (instructional) process. Such as approach is necessary, if one takes into consideration the the complex and holistic nature of the learning process. The presented modeling is based on the definition of an automatic regulation system and artificial intelligence techniques. For this purpose, an Intelligent Instructional System (ITS) is defined using the concepts: inputs, outputs, perturbations factors, regulation, feedback and AI learning techniques. The contextual environment of learning plays the major role in this system and it establishes the perturbation factors. The regulation consists in AI learning techniques, so the ITS is a flexible and adaptive system. The process' behaviour is described using pseudo-boolean and linear equations. This kind of approach enables solving the problems of the complexity and uncertainty of the learning (instructional) systems and, particularly, those of the e-learning (online and offline). Applications of the proposed approach may be found in e-learning courses for Mathematics, Computing, Architecture, Archaeology, Cultural Heritage, etc.;Moise - 2008 - A formal description of the systemic theory based .txt

Although used abundantly to justify our interest in ancient societies, this statement lacks practical meaning due to the high degree of uncertainty which cloaks archaeological studies and theories, and the fact that there is no real way to prove or validate them. That is why it is so important to approach this study from a multidisciplinary point of view, providing several inputs which complement each other and so maximize the amount of factual information drawn from the analysis. Even then, the study will never be truly complete because there will always be a missing document, a small trace of an object (Verhagen, 2008), that still needs to be analysed. This paper aims to be a useful contribution to historical research, specifically to the study of architectural history. Its purpose is to create a series of methods and tools for testing and analysing theories and hypotheses for historical scenarios (Vasaros, 2008) through the use of 3D modelling tools and Virtual Reality (VR) engines. The project was developed in two stages: The first was the creation of several three-dimensional (3D) models, each representing a different theory or hypothesis. The models were based on accurate Computer Assisted Design (CAD) (Autodesk (R) AutoCAD) models for the reconstruction of the buildings, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) (ESRI (R)) for the recreation of the terrain, thereby creating a realistic representation of what exists now, and a close approximation to what may have once existed. In the second stage, a simplified version of the models was imported into a Virtual Reality (VR) game engine (Bethesda Softworks (R)) to create the ambience of the villa at the time, allowing full exploration of the space. It also includes fauna and flora, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven avatars, as can be seen in the Video 1 provided in the electronic version of this manuscript. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The most controversial question of these algorithms is their poor performance on real world applications. To overcome such limitation this research work focuses on generating more efficient detectors through a more flexible boundary for self patterns. Rather than applying conventional affinity measures, the detectors are generated benefiting from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted on normal space. From the GMM capabilities the algorithm is able to dynamically determine efficient subsets of detectors. In order to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, different data sets have been examined as benchmark, including 2D synthesis data sets. Furthermore, for evaluating the capability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on real-world problems, it has been performed and tested for detecting anomalies in archaeological sites located in Lorestan, Iran. The experimental results prove how the proposed approach helps the negative selection algorithm to improve its detection capability, because the detectors can be efficiently distributed into the non-self space. It is important to note how this research work presents also a first analysis of the anomaly detection capabilities in the field of archaeology, introducing a novel application method, which can be efficiently used by the archaeologists for interpreting their growing amount of data and draw valuable conclusions about the historical past. Finally, in order to analyse the convergence and the running time of the proposed algorithm, a study has been conducted using the classical Time-To-Target plots, which present a standard graphical methodology for data analysis based on the comparisons between the empirical and theoretical distributions.

Design/methodology/approach Through an extensive literature review, this article maps out the current capabilities, challenges and limitations of NER and establishes the state of the art of the technique in the context of the early modern, digitally augmented research field. It also presents a new case study of NER research undertaken by Enlightenment Architectures: Sir Hans Sloane's Catalogues of his Collections (2016-2021), a Leverhulme funded research project and collaboration between the British Museum and University College London, with contributing expertise from the British Library and the Natural History Museum. Findings Currently, it is not possible to benchmark the capabilities of NER as applied to documents of the early modern period. The authors also draw attention to the situated nature of authority files, and current conceptualisations of NER, leading them to the conclusion that more robust reporting and critical analysis of NER approaches and findings is required. Research limitations/implications This article examines NER as applied to early modern textual sources, which are mostly studied by Humanists. As addressed in this article, detailed reporting of NER processes and outcomes is not necessarily valued by the disciplines of the Humanities, with the result that it can be difficult to locate relevant data and metrics in project outputs. The authors have tried to mitigate this by contacting projects discussed in this paper directly, to further verify the details they report here. Practical implications The authors suggest that a forum is needed where tools are evaluated according to community standards. Within the wider NER community, the MUC and ConLL corpora are used for such experimental set-ups and are accompanied by a conference series, and may be seen as a useful model for this. The ultimate nature of such a forum must be discussed with the whole research community of the early modern domain. Social implications NER is an algorithmic intervention that transforms data according to certain rules-, patterns- or training data and ultimately affects how the authors interpret the results. The creation, use and promotion of algorithmic technologies like NER is not a neutral process, and neither is their output A more critical understanding of the role and impact of NER on early modern documents and research and focalization of some of the data- and human-centric aspects of NER routines that are currently overlooked are called for in this paper. Originality/value This article presents a state of the art snapshot of NER, its applications and potential, in the context of early modern research. It also seeks to inform discussions about the kinds of resources, methods and directions that may be pursued to enrich the application of NER going forward. It draws attention to the situated nature of authority files, and current conceptualisations of NER, and concludes that more robust reporting of NER approaches and findings are urgently required.

ZZH8V8VF;journalArticle;2018;"Preston, V; Salumae, T; Kruusmaa, M";Underwater confined space mapping by resource-constrained autonomous vehicle;JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS;For marine industrial inspection, archaeology, and geological formation study, the ability to map unknown underwater enclosed and confined spaces is desirable and well suited for robotic vehicles. To date, there are few solutions thoroughly tested in the field designed to perform this specific task, none of which operate autonomously. With a small, low-cost biomimetic platform known as the U-CAT, we developed a mapping-mission software architecture in which the vehicle executes three key sensor-based reactive stages: entering, exploring, and exiting. Encapsulated in the exploring stage are several state-defined navigation strategies, called patterns, which were designed and initially tested in simulation. The results of simulation work informed the selection of two patterns that were executed in field trials at a submerged building in Rummu Quarry Lake, Estonia, as part of several full mapping missions. Over the course of these trials, the vehicle was capable of observing the majority (78-97%) of 49.9 explorable square meters within 7 minutes. Based on these results, we demonstrate the capability of a low-cost and resource-constrained vehicle to perform confined space mapping under sensor uncertainty. Further, the observations made by the vehicle are shown to be suitable for a target site reconstruction and analysis in post-processing, which is the intended outcome of this type of mission in practical applications.;rob.21806.txt

Here, we present an innovative method for identifying community structures in the archaeological record that allows for independent evaluation of the copper using societies in the Balkans, from c. 6200 to c. 3200 BC. We achieve this by exploring modularity of networked systems of these societies across an estimated 3000 years. We employ chemical data of copper-based objects from 79 archaeological sites as the independent variable for detecting most densely interconnected sets of nodes with a modularity maximization method [4]. Our results reveal three dominant modular structures across the entire period, which exhibit strong spatial and temporal significance. We interpret patterns of copper supply among prehistoric societies as reflective of social relations, which emerge as equally important as physical proximity. Although designed on a variable isolated from any archaeological and spatiotemporal information, our method provides archaeologically and spatiotemporally meaningful results. It produces models of human interaction and cooperation that can be evaluated independently of established archaeological systematics, and can find wide application on any quantitative data from archaeological and historical record.;Radivojevic et Grujic - 2018 - Community structure of copper supply networks in t.txt

This study is devoted to rapidly reconstructing 3D personalized mandibles, especially when the mandible is severely damaged or totally lost. An example-oriented method based on principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reconstruct the 3D shapes of mandibles. The predictor variable is an input cranium, while the response variables is a full mandible. The linear relationship between the cranium and mandible is obtained based on a number of skull samples, which is used as prior knowledge. The PCA method reduces the dimensionality of the skull data to improve the accuracy and speed of the reconstruction process. Experiments are conducted based on 215 skull models in the Chinese craniofacial database established in the study of craniofacial morphology informatics at Beijing Normal University. In our experiments, parameters are modified to help improve the reconstruction results. The proposed method exhibits higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods according to comparison experiments results. Moreover, this method is robust to various types of input data and noise. Results indicate the proposed method is a fast and feasible tool for reconstructing 3D customized full mandibles.;Yan et al. - 2022 - Example-oriented full mandible reconstruction base.txt

In this paper, based on the synthetic feature method, we propose a novel 3D skull descriptor, synthetic wave kernel distance distribution (SWKDD) constructed by the laplace-beltrami operator. By defining SWKDD, we obtain a concise global skull representation method and transform the complex 3D skull similarity measurement into a simple 1D vector similarity measurement. First, we give the definition and calculation of SWKDD and analyse its properties. Second, we represent a framework for 3D skull similarity measurement using the SWKDD of 3D skulls and details of the calculation steps involved.

This paper tries to address this issue, by proposing a personalized and content adaptive cultural heritage path recommendation system, where location is modeled using mean-shift clustering trained with actual user movement patters. Additionally, topic modeling is incorporated to formalize the implicit cultural heritage content, while first order Markov models address the movement as a temporal transition aspect of the problem. The overall architecture is applied on data collected from actual visits to the archaeological sites of Gournia and Catalhoyuk and extensive analysis on visitor movement patterns follows, especially in comparison to the curated paths in the aforementioned sites.

Ongoing research in underwater robotics intends to increase the autonomy of intervention operations that require physical interaction in order to achieve social benefits in fields such as archaeology or biology that cannot afford the expenses of costly underwater operations using remote operated vehicles. Autonomous grasping is still a very challenging skill, especially in underwater environments, with highly unstructured scenarios, limited availability of sensors and adverse conditions that affect the robot perception and control systems. To tackle these issues, we propose the use of vision and segmentation techniques that aim to improve the specification of grasping operations on underwater primitive shaped objects. Several sources of stereo information are used to gather 3D information in order to obtain a model of the object. Using a RANSAC segmentation algorithm, the model parameters are estimated and a set of feasible grasps are computed. This approach is validated in both simulated and real underwater scenarios.;Fornas et al. - 2016 - Fitting primitive shapes in point clouds a practi.txt

Evidence from linguistics and archaeology indicates that the 'Austronesian expansion,' which began 4,000-5,000 years ago, likely had roots in Taiwan, but the ancestry of present-day Austronesian-speaking populations remains controversial. Here, we analyse genome-wide data from 56 populations using new methods for tracing ancestral gene flow, focusing primarily on Island Southeast Asia. We show that all sampled Austronesian groups harbour ancestry that is more closely related to aboriginal Taiwanese than to any present-day mainland population. Surprisingly, western Island Southeast Asian populations have also inherited ancestry from a source nested within the variation of present-day populations speaking Austro-Asiatic languages, which have historically been nearly exclusive to the mainland. Thus, either there was once a substantial Austro-Asiatic presence in Island Southeast Asia, or Austronesian speakers migrated to and through the mainland, admixing there before continuing to western Indonesia.;Lipson et al. - 2014 - Reconstructing Austronesian population history in .txt

Its major challenges are the fact that 3D skulls are geometric models with multiple holes and complex topologies, there are facial expression changes on the 3D faces. Therefore, the general 3D shape similarity measurements, which are sensitive to boundaries and expression changes, make it impossible to simultaneously measure skull and face similarity. In this paper, we define a 3D signature to describe the pure intrinsic structure and distinguish the similar basic shape and complex topology of 3D skulls and faces: the harmonic wave kernel signature (HWKS). The HWKS is a point descriptor involving the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which is able to effectively extract geometrical and topological information from 3D skulls and faces. Based on the HWKS, we provide an effective pipeline for 3D skull and face similarity measurement by calculating the cosine distance between the HWKS values of 3D skulls and faces. By making comparisons with the wave kernel signature, the HWKS simultaneously describes both local and global properties of a shape. Results from a number of experiments have already shown that our framework is suitable for both measure 3D skull similarity and face similarity, and more importantly, measuring skull similarity and face similarity are two independent processes although using the same framework. By using the same measurement method for 3D skull similarity and face similarity, we observe an effective craniofacial relationship under unified metrics: The change rate of skull similarity is generally consistent with the corresponding face similarity, indicating the correlation between the shape of the 3D skull and its corresponding 3D face shape. And our experimental results show the rationality and effectiveness of this method, which refers to the previous researchers measure the similarity of the reconstructed face from the original skull to reflect the similarity of the original skull.;Zhang et al. - 2021 - 3D skull and face similarity measurements based on.txt

SC3FQK2I;journalArticle;2017;"Belussi, A; Migliorini, S";A spatio-temporal framework for managing archeological data;ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE;Space and time are two important characteristics of data in many domains. This is particularly true in the archaeological context where information concerning the discovery location of objects allows one to derive important relations between findings of a specific survey or even of different surveys, and time aspects extend from the excavation time, to the dating of archaeological objects. In recent years, several attempts have been performed to develop a spatio-temporal information system tailored for archaeological data.The first aim of this paper is to propose a model, called tar, for representing spatio-temporal data in archaeology. In particular, since in this domain dates are often subjective, estimated and imprecise, tar has to incorporate such vague representation by using fuzzy dates and fuzzy relationships among them. Moreover, besides to the topological relations, another kind of spatial relations is particularly useful in archeology: the stratigraphic ones. Therefore, this paper defines a set of rules for deriving temporal knowledge from the topological and stratigraphic relations existing between two findings. Finally, considering the process through which objects are usually manually dated by archeologists, some existing automatic reasoning techniques may be successfully applied to guide such process. For this purpose, the last contribution regards the translation of archaeological temporal data into a Fuzzy Temporal Constraint Network for checking the overall data consistency and reducing the vagueness of some dates based on their relationships with other ones.;Belussi et Migliorini - 2017 - A spatio-temporal framework for managing archeolog.txt
Y5UXLP6F;journalArticle;2018;"Chen, LF; Cao, D; Liu, Y";A New Intelligent Jigsaw Puzzle Algorithm Base on Mixed Similarity and Symbol Matrix;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE;Jigsaw puzzle algorithm is important as it can be applied to many areas such as biology, image editing, archaeology and incomplete crime-scene reconstruction. But, still, some problems exist in the process of practical application, for example, when there are a large number of similar objects in the puzzle fragments, the error rate will reach 30%-50%. When some fragments are missing, most algorithms fail to restore the images accurately. When the number of fragments of the jigsaw puzzle is large, efficiency is reduced. During the intelligent puzzle, mainly the Sum of Squared Distance Scoring (SSD), Mahalanobis Gradient Compatibility (MGC) and other metrics are used to calculate the similarity between the fragments. On the basis of these two measures, we put forward some new methods: 1. MGC is one of the most effective measures, but using MGC to reassemble the puzzle can cause an error image every 30 or 50 times, so we combine the Jaccard and MGC metric measure to compute the similarity between the image fragments, and reassemble the puzzle with a greedy algorithm. This algorithm not only reduces the error rate, but can also maintain a high accuracy in the case of a large number of fragments of similar objects. 2. For the lack of fragmentation and low efficiency, this paper uses a new method of SSD measurement and mark matrix, it is general in the sense that it can handle puzzles of unknown size, with fragments of unknown orientation, and even puzzles with missing fragments.

The Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) has obtained precise photometry in 12 specially designed filters for large numbers of Galactic stars. Deriving their precise stellar atmospheric parameters and individual elemental abundances is crucial for studies of Galactic structure and the assembly history and chemical evolution of our Galaxy. Aims. Our goal is to estimate not only stellar parameters (effective temperature, T-eff, surface gravity, log g, and metallicity, [Fe/H]), but also [alpha/Fe] and four elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [N/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [Ca/Fe]) using data from the first data release (DR1) of J-PLUS. Methods. By combining recalibrated photometric data from J-PLUS DR1, Gaia DR2, and spectroscopic labels from the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, we designed and trained a set of cost-sensitive neural networks, the CSNet, to learn the nonlinear mapping from stellar colours to their labels. Special attention was paid to the poorly populated regions of the label space by giving different weights according to their density distribution. Results. We achieved precisions of delta T-eff similar to 55 K, delta log g similar to 0.15 dex, and delta [Fe/H] similar to 0.07 dex, respectively, over a wide range of temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities. The uncertainties of the abundance estimates for [alpha/Fe] and the four individual elements are in the 0.04-0.08 dex range. We compare our parameter and abundance estimates with those from other spectroscopic catalogs such as the Apache Point Observatory for Galactic Evolution Experiment and the Galactic Archaeology with High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph and find an overall good agreement. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate the potential of well-designed, high-quality photometric data for determinations of stellar parameters as well as individual elemental abundances. Applying the method to J-PLUS DR1, we obtained the aforementioned parameters for about two million stars, providing an outstanding dataset for chemo-dynamic analyses of the Milky Way. The catalog of the estimated parameters is publicly accessible.;Yang et al. - 2022 - J-PLUS Stellar parameters, C, N, Mg, Ca, and [alp.txt

The main challenges are the rough conditions with extremely high pressure, the accessibility of target areas (container and ship deployment of robust sensors, then diving for hours to the ocean floor), and the limitations of localization technologies (no GPS). The absence of natural light complicates energy budget considerations for deep diving flash-equipped drones. Refraction effects influence geometric image formation considerations with respect to field of view and focus, while attenuation and scattering degrade the radiometric image quality and limit the effective visibility. As an improvement on the stated issues, we present an AUV-based optical system intended for autonomous visual mapping of large areas of the seafloor (square kilometers) in up to 6000 m water depth. We compare it to existing systems and discuss tradeoffs such as resolution vs. mapped area and show results from a recent deployment with 90,000 mapped square meters of deep ocean floor.;Kwasnitschka et al. - 2016 - DeepSurveyCam-A Deep Ocean Optical Mapping System.txt

Geostatistics allows producing these maps from a sample of locations by modelling the spatial autocorrelation structure of these kind of phenomena. However, the homogeneity of the prediction regions is a strong assumption in the model. The presence of barriers, such as the inner walls of domestic units, introduces discontinuities in prediction areas. In this paper, we investigate how to incorporate information of a geographical nature into the process of geostatistical prediction. We propose the use of cost-based distances to quantify the correlation between locations, a solution which has proved to be a practical alternative approach for archaeological intrasite analysis. The cost-based approach produces more reliable results avoiding the unrealistic assumption of the homogeneity of the study area. As a working example, a case study of the distribution of two specific chemical signatures in domestic floors is presented within a controlled ethnographical context in Northern Gujarat (India). On a broad disciplinary scale, the benefits of using our approach include improved estimates in regions with complex geometry and lower uncertainty in the kriging predictions. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

They are also unique in the ubiquitous adaptation to all biomes and habitats. From an evolutionary perspective, these trends seem to have started about two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of encephalization, the reduction of the dental apparatus, the adoption of a fully terrestrial lifestyle, resulting in the emergence of the modern anatomical bauplan, the focalization of certain activities in the landscape, the use of stone tools, and the exit from Africa. It is in this period that clear taphonomic evidence of a switch in diet with respect to Pliocene hominins occurred, with the adoption of carnivory. Until now, the degree of carnivorism in early humans remained controversial. A persistent hypothesis is that hominins acquired meat irregularly (potentially as fallback food) and opportunistically through klepto-foraging. Here, we test this hypothesis and show, in contrast, that the butchery practices of early Pleistocene hominins (unveiled through systematic study of the patterning and intensity of cut marks on their prey) could not have resulted from having frequent secondary access to carcasses. We provide evidence of hominin primary access to animal resources and emphasize the role that meat played in their diets, their ecology and their anatomical evolution, ultimately resulting in the ecologically unrestricted terrestrial adaptation of our species. This has major implications to the evolution of human physiology and potentially for the evolution of the human brain.;Dominguez-Rodrigo et al. - 2021 - Early Pleistocene faunivorous hominins were not kl.txt

The identity defines the orientation of public actions to take and establishes an informal interaction network for circulating important information and material resources. While domestic social movements emphasize the coherence of identity in alliance, global or cyber-activism is now flexible in its collective identity given the rise of the Internet. A campaign may include diverse social movement organizations (SMOs) with different social agendas. This flexible identity framing encourages personal involvement in direct action. On the other hand, it may damage solidarity within SMOs and make campaigns difficult to control. To assess the sustainability of an SMO, it is important to understand its collective identity and the social codes embedded within its associated cyber-societies and cyber-artifacts. In this study, we took a cyber-archeology approach and used the international Falun Gong (FLG) movement as a case study to investigate this identity-framing issue. We employed social network analysis and Writeprint to analyze FLG's cyber-artifacts from the perspectives of links, web content, and forum content. In the link analysis, FLG's websites linked closely to Chinese democracy and human rights SMOs, reflecting FLG's historical conflicts with the Chinese government after the official ban in 1999. In the web content analysis, we used Writeprint to analyze the writings of Hongzhi Li and of his editors, and found that Hongzhi Li's writings center around the ideological teaching of Falun Dafa while the editors post specific programs to realize Li's teaching. In the forum content analysis, FLG comprehensively organizes several different concepts on a continuum: from FLG ideology to life philosophy and mysterious phenomena, and from mysterious phenomena to anti-Chinese Communist Party and persecution by conceptualizing the Chinese government as the Evil. By deploying those cyber-artifacts, FLG seamlessly connects different ideologies and establishes its identity as a Qi-Gong, religious, and activist group.;Chen et al. - 2010 - Framing Social Movement Identity with Cyber-Artifa.txt

We are interested here in the classification of pottery into coiling and spiral types based on their manufacturing techniques. To distinguish between these two techniques, we look for the lines formed by air bubbles embedded in the pottery samples. Current methods make use of bulky systems, such as computerized tomography scanners or synchrotrons. Microwave acquisition and processing offer an interesting alternative, due to the possibility to have compact and portable systems. In this article, we investigate the classification of pottery based on low-terahertz measurements in the D-band. We process the measurements with 3-D fast Fourier transform. The resulting matrix is classified with an artificial neural network, multilayer perceptron, which is optimized with the gray wolf optimizer, a bioinspired algorithm. The first results show that the accuracy reaches up to 99% using all the acquired spatial and frequency measurements. Then, we optimize the millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) measurement system with a critical criterion on accuracy in two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we reduce the spatial acquisition but maintain the wideband operation and the results show that the accuracy is between 85% and 96%. In the second one, we reduce the spatial acquisition and use a single frequency. For this second scenario, we achieve a classification accuracy, which is between 77% and 100%.;NA

The early identification of changes is crucial to preventive conservation. Archaeologists have always considered using service drones to automate collecting data on and below the ground surface of archaeological sites, with cost and technical barriers being the main hurdles against the wide-scale deployment. Advances in thermal imaging, depth imaging, drones, and artificial intelligence have driven the cost down and improved the quality and volume of data collected and processed. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework for archaeological sites detection and monitoring using autonomous service drones. We mount RGB, depth, and thermal cameras on an autonomous drone for low-altitude data acquisition. To align and aggregate collected images, we propose two-stage multimodal depth-to-RGB and thermal-to-RGB mosaicking algorithms. We then apply detection algorithms to the stitched images to identify change regions and design a user interface to monitor these regions over time. Our results show we can create overlays of aligned thermal and depth data on RGB mosaics of archaeological sites. We tested our change detection algorithm and found it has a root mean square error of 0.04. To validate the proposed framework, we tested our thermal image stitching pipeline against state-of-the-art commercial software. We cost-effectively replicated its functionality while adding a new depth-based modality and created a user interface for temporally monitoring changes in multimodal views of archaeological sites.;Khelifi et al. - 2021 - Autonomous Service Drones for Multimodal Detection.txt

While typically used in the study of biological and anatomical variance, modern applications now incorporate these tools into a number of different fields of non-biological origin. Nevertheless, as with many fields of data science, Geometric Morphometric techniques are often impeded by issues concerning sample size. The present study thus evaluates a number of different computational learning algorithms for the augmentation of different datasets. Here we show how generative algorithms from Artificial Intelligence are able to produce highly realistic synthetic data; helping improve the quality of any statistical or predictive modelling applications that may follow. The fossil record is notorious for being incomplete and distorted, frequently conditioning the type of knowledge that can be extracted from it. In many cases, this often leads to issues when performing complex statistical analyses, such as classification tasks, predictive modelling, and variance analyses, such as those used in Geometric Morphometrics. Here different Generative Adversarial Network architectures are experimented with, testing the effects of sample size and domain dimensionality on model performance. For model evaluation, robust statistical methods were used. Each of the algorithms were observed to produce realistic data. Generative Adversarial Networks using different loss functions produced multidimensional synthetic data significantly equivalent to the original training data. Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks were not as successful. The methods proposed are likely to reduce the impact of sample size and bias on a number of statistical learning applications. While Generative Adversarial Networks are not the solution to all sample-size related issues, combined with other pre-processing steps these limitations may be overcome.

In this paper we describe the application of some of these techniques in the domain of archaeology through two different applications: the reconstruction of complete archaeological sites and the reconstruction of broken objects from their fragments. Both applications are illustrated with concrete examples: the reconstruction of a necropolis in Itanos (Crete) and a Gallo-Roman sanctuary in Blicquy (Belgium) and the partial reconstruction of a fragmented stone sculpture from the church of Saints Michel-et-Gudule in Brussels (Belgium).;Milojevic et al. - 2005 - Computers and 3D image synthesis as tools for arch.txt

The data being analysed are 26- and 18-dimensional mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal haplogroup distributions representing 50 recent and 34 ancient populations in Eurasia and America. The algorithms search for associations of haplogroups jointly propagating in a significant subset of these populations. Joint propagations of Hgs are detected directly by similar ranking lists of populations derived from Hg frequencies of the 50 Hg distributions. The method provides us the most characteristic associations of mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal haplogroups, and the set of populations where these associations propagate jointly. In addition, the typical ranking lists characterizing these Hg associations show the geographical distribution, the probable place of origin and the paths of their protection. Comparison to ancient data verifies that these recent geographical distributions refer to the most important prehistoric migrations supported by archaeological evidences.;Juhasz et al. - 2018 - A new self-learning computational method for footp.txt

The tools we use to approach archaeological research questions range from the trowel and brush to, more recently, even those of artificial intelligence. As access to computing technology has increased over time, the breadth of computer-assisted methods in archaeology has also increased. This proliferation has provided us a considerable toolset towards engaging both new and longstanding questions, especially as interdisciplinary collaboration between archaeologists, computer scientists, and engineers continues to grow. As an example of an archaeological project engaging in computer-based approaches, the Guadalupe/Colon Archaeological Project is presented as a case study. Project applications and methodologies range from the regional-scale identification of sites using a geographic information system (GIS) or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) down to the microscopic scale of classifying ceramic materials with convolutional neural networks. Methods relating to the 3D modeling of sites, features, and artifacts and the benefits therein are also explored. In this paper, an overview of the methods used by the project is covered, which includes 1) predictive modeling using a GIS slope analysis for the identification of possible site locations, 2) structure from motion (SfM) drone imagery for site mapping and characterization, 3) airborne LiDAR for site identification, mapping, and characterization, 4) 3D modeling of stone features for improved visualization, 5) 3D modeling of ceramic artifacts for more efficient documentation, and 6) the application of deep learning for automated classification of ceramic materials in thin section. These approaches are discussed and critically considered with the understanding that interdisciplinary cooperation between domain experts in engineering, computer science, and archaeology is an important means of improving and expanding upon digital methodologies in archaeology as a whole.;LYONS_2022.txt

However, parameter calibration is insufficient to conduct data-driven explorations that are adequate in evaluating the importance of causal factors that constitute agent rules that match real-world individual-scale generative behaviors. We introduce evolutionary model discovery, a framework that combines genetic programming and random forest regression to evaluate the importance of a set of causal factors hypothesized to affect the individual's decision-making process. With evolutionary model discovery, we investigated the farm plot seeking behavior of the Ancestral Pueblo of the Long House Valley simulated in the Artificial Anasazi model. We evaluated the importance of causal factors unconsidered in the original model, which we hypothesized to have affected the decision-making process. Our findings, concur with other archaeological studies on the Ancestral Pueblo communities during the Pueblo II period, which indicate the existence of cross-village polities, hierarchical organization, and dependence on the viability of the agricultural niche. Contrary to the original Artificial Anasazi model, where closeness was the sole factor driving farm plot selection, selection of higher quality land, distancing from failed farm plots, and desire for social presence are found to be more important. Finally, models updated with farm selection strategies designed by incorporating these insights showed significant improvements in accuracy and robustness over the original Artificial Anasazi model.;Gunaratne et Garibay - 2020 - Evolutionary model discovery of causal factors beh.txt

Initially, they are neglected as all the archaeological wooden materials are, due to their perishable nature. Secondly, they are neglected since archaeologists tend to ignore them on their analysis as they are not final products or bigger structural elements. In this paper, it will be discussed the importance that even those materials can have regarding the wood procurement and elaboration processes, which will never be entirely studied without adding debris and formless pieces of wood into the equation. Based on the archaeological example of the waterlogged Neolithic site of la Draga (Banyoles, Spain), it will be discussed the way in which wood as raw material is obtained and transported to the settlement, and the ways the elaboration process is realized.;Lopez-Bulto - 2020 - Wood analysis and beyond Contribution of twice-ne.txt

The theoretical framework is the integration between photogrammetric survey and documentation process, practically used in different archaeological excavation. Information is sorted by source. A source is a set of information provided by the operators involved in the excavation process. The merging process involves the verification of the consistency of different sources and the aggregation of all the information from the sources into a global result. Each source, respectively each operator, owns a personal representation of his knowledge domain. Merging together all these sets of information needs a method which can be easily operated by most of the participants in the research and which can furthermore manage the 'multiple knowledge' on the surveyed object. The merge process is theoretically defined in a reversible framework for propositional bases merging. This framework is presented in a semantic way and applied by the development of merging tool. This tool uses a simple interface for displaying results and knowledge in various form (textual, 2D map, 3D scene, XML). The tool provides a simple easy to use interface.

From the first hominin groups, carnivores have played a fundamental role in the ecosystem. From this perspective, understanding the trophic pressure between hominins and carnivores can provide valuable insights into the context in which humans survived, interacted with their surroundings, and consequently evolved. While numerous techniques already exist for the detection of carnivore activity in archaeological and palaeontological sites, many of these techniques present important limitations. The present study builds on a number of advanced data science techniques to confront these issues, defining methods for the identification of the precise agents involved in carcass consumption and manipulation. For the purpose of this study, a large sample of 620 carnivore tooth pits is presented, including samples from bears, hyenas, jaguars, leopards, lions, wolves, foxes and African wild dogs. Using 3D modelling, geometric morphometrics, robust data modelling, and artificial intelligence algorithms, the present study obtains between 88 and 98% accuracy, with balanced overall evaluation metrics across all datasets. From this perspective, and when combined with other sources of taphonomic evidence, these results show that advanced data science techniques can be considered a valuable addition to the taphonomist's toolkit for the identification of precise carnivore agents via tooth pit morphology.;Courtenay et al. - 2021 - Developments in data science solutions for carnivo.txt

Different from most classical low-level image segmentation methods that are known to be very sensitive to the noise and occlusions, we propose a new supervised learning algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to implicitly learn and utilize more curve geometry and pattern information for addressing this challenging problem. More specifically, we first propose a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to estimate the skeleton of curve structures and at each skeleton pixel, a scale value is estimated to reflect the local curve width. Then we propose a dense prediction network to refine the estimated curve skeletons. Based on the estimated scale values, we finally develop an adaptive thresholding algorithm to achieve the final segmentation of curve structures. In the experiment, we validate the performance of the proposed method on a dataset of depth images scanned from unearthed pottery sherds dating to the Woodland period of Southeastern North America.;Lu_2018.txt

The analysis includes existing project proposals for buildings on Mars and effective means of protecting them against the negative impact of the environment, taking into account the experience of construction in complicated conditions on Earth. The detailed analysis of data allowed us to determine the parameters for the choice of location for building a colony. The parameters include soil composition, climatic indicators, terrain, level of cosmic radiation, methane fluctuations places, the equator zone, promising places for research, and successful landing places of the previous missions. Based on this, we justified the choice of the building complex location, which is the decisive factor for construction. An important aspect is also the determination of the planet colonization stages and the building requirements based on the needs of the colony. A project proposal has been developed for the second stage of planetary colonization. A colony is a quasi-closed system with its own \life cycle\"", consuming only its own resources and available resources of the planet. The viability parameters of the project determine the full colony \""life cycle\"". We propose the hierarchical system of functions of the research mission complex.

Pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs spatial analysis in La Draga (Banyoles, NE Iberia);JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE;Several taphonomic factors influence the composition of the palynological record especially in archaeological deposits, where human activities alter the representation of taxa. Spatial analysis by a taphonomic approach to the distribution of pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP) provides useful information about intra-site spaces and environments in the Early Neolithic lakeside settlement of La Draga (Banyoles, NE Iberia). The spatial correlation of algae, lakeshore and aquatic plants and herbs with an economic value, together with eggs of intestinal parasites and spores of coprophilous fungi, evidence a humid and organic environment beneath a hut, where consumption waste is concentrated. In contrast, high values of arboreal pollen (AP) and spores of fungal indicators of soil erosion show a sub-aerial environment strongly altered by taphonomic processes in outside areas. Finally, the association of the highest values in Cerealia-t and the spatial distribution of grinding stones within Sector D identifies an area of cereal processing, proving the suitability of spatial analysis in archaeopalynology as a powerful tool for reconstructing activity areas within archaeological settlements.

This information, which is related to the temporal occurrence of landslide phenomena and their causes, is often fragmented and heterogeneous. The present study evaluates the landslide susceptibility map of the Natural Archaeological Park of Matera (Southern Italy) (Sassi and area Rupestrian Churches sites). The assessment of the degree of \spatial hazard\"" or \""susceptibility\"" was carried out by the spatial prediction regardless of the return time of the events. The evaluation model for the susceptibility presented in this paper is very focused on the use of innovative techniques of artificial intelligence such as Neural Network, Fuzzy Logic and Neuro-fuzzy Network. The method described in this paper is a novel technique based on a neuro-fuzzy system. It is able to train data like neural network and it is able to shape and control uncertain and complex systems like a fuzzy system. This methodology allows us to derive susceptibility maps of the study area. These data are obtained from thematic maps representing the parameters responsible for the instability of the slopes. The parameters used in the analysis are: plan curvature, elevation (DEM), angle and aspect of the slope, lithology, fracture density, kinematic hazard index of planar and wedge sliding and toppling. Moreover, this method is characterized by the network training which uses a training matrix, consisting of input and output training data, which determine the landslide susceptibility. The neuro-fuzzy method was integrated to a sensitivity analysis in order to overcome the uncertainty linked to the used membership functions. The method was compared to the landslide inventory map and was validated by applying three methods: a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis, a confusion matrix and a SCAI method.

These resources had the potential of being used as food and medicine, but also as tinder. Fire was without a doubt one of the most important resources for past people. It was used for lighting, heating, processing food and other materials, cooking and protection, and also possessed social and ritual significance. Hearths are one of the most common features at archaeological sites, but very often little attention is paid to the question of how these fires were lit, and they are seldom reflected in the archaeological record. In order to produce fire by percussion, an intermediate material is required between the sparks and the fuel. Fruiting bodies of fungi are a potential form of tinder, but are less inclined to be well-preserved than other materials.

Ancient Libraries showcase a significant variability of scale, monumentality, and design with the use of different architectural components, and researchers cannot identify them as easily as other building types. The grammar is in 2D and captures all the variability of libraries from the simpler forms of the Hellenistic period to the more monumental of the Roman period, creating a vast range of designs. The paper presents the grammar-generated plans of the known libraries based on the evidence in the archaeological record. A frequency analysis of the occurrence of the rules in the derivations ranks the different characteristics of libraries and the architectural forms with which they occur in the corpus, to determine the probability of specific rules and to interpret them as mandatory or optional. The contribution of this work is that the shape grammar summarizes the design principles of ancient libraries visually and helps establish the building type of the ancient library. The frequency analysis assists tremendously in the reconstruction of fragmentarily preserved ancient libraries by providing a system in the reconstruction of the missing parts, when ambiguity is involved.;Mamoli - 2020 - A shape grammar for the building-type definition o.txt

Instances of temporal concepts such as time intervals are used for the annotation of cultural objects and also for querying datasets containing information about these objects. Hence it is important to match query and annotation intervals by examining their similarity or closeness. One of the problems is that in many cases time intervals are imprecise. For example, the boundaries of the \Pre-Roman age\"" and the \""Roman age\"" are inherently imprecise and it may be difficult to distinguish them with clear-cut intervals. In this paper we apply the fuzzy set theory to model imprecise time intervals in order to determine relevance of the relationship between two time intervals. We present a method for matching query and annotation intervals based on their weighted mutual overlapping and closeness. We present (1) methods for calculating these eights to produce a combined measure and (2) results of comparing the combined measure with human evaluators as a case study. The case study takes into consideration archaeological temporal information, which is in most cases inherently fuzzy, and therefore offers a particularly complex and challenging scenario. The results show that our new combined measure that utilizes different weighted measures together in rankings, performs the best in terms of precision and recall. It should be used when ranking annotation intervals according to a given query interval in cultural heritage information retrieval. Our approach intends to be generalizable: overlapping and closeness may be calculated between any two fuzzy temporal intervals. The presented procedure of using user evaluation results as a basis for assigning weights for overlapping and closeness could potentially be used to reveal weights in other domains and purposes as well.

This industry was defined based on the lithic assemblages recovered from Hagfet ed Dabba and the nearby Haua Fteah site. We studied the lithic material from Level VI of the Hagfet ed Dabba site, which was excavated by Prof. McBurney in 1949. The aim of the lithic production was to obtain blade/bladelets through bidirectional and unidirectional prismatic methods. Blanks are of two types: wide, non-curved and straight blade/bladelets and narrow and pointed blades/bladelets. The blanks were modified mostly into backed pieces/points and Chamfered pieces. We discuss the role and possible contacts of the Dabban in understanding the Later Stone Age in northern Africa and the Initial Upper Palaeolithic and Upper Palaeolithic in the Near East. Following the technological analysis of Level VI, we consider the Early Dabban as representing an independent and local industry of the Early Later Stone Age with possible influences from the Levantine IUP and Ahmarian industries. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of direct affiliation with any of them, and the industry indeed portrays its own specific characteristics.;Maillo-Fernandez et Jimenez-Garcia - 2021 - Lithic technology at the Early Dabban in Hagfet ed.txt

However, little literature studied the automatic extraction of these surfaces from the 3-D SBP data currently. Thus, this article proposes a hybrid method consisting of a surface extraction algorithm and a segmentation algorithm. First, the multiprofile SBP data are converted into 3-D data volume. Second, by taking full advantage of the plate-like characteristic of the layer surface in the 3-D SBP data, a plate-like enhancement filtering algorithm based on the nonuniform Gaussian scale is given to filter the 3-D data volume. Third, a threshold extraction is applied to extract surface voxels, and a hybrid region growing algorithm is put forward to segment surface voxels into basic units by combining multicriteria. Finally, the surface segmentation problem is formulated as global energy optimization, and a stepwise segmentation algorithm is proposed to get the final surface set. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted and analyzed. The results showed that the proposed method performed well.;Li_2022a.txt

Data-driven methods allowed us to uncover networks of genes distinguishing the three major systems of modern human personality and adaptability: emotional reactivity, self-control, and self-awareness. Now we have identified which of these genes are present in chimpanzees and Neanderthals. We replicated our findings in separate analyses of three high-coverage genomes of Neanderthals. We found that Neanderthals had nearly the same genes for emotional reactivity as chimpanzees, and they were intermediate between modern humans and chimpanzees in their numbers of genes for both self-control and self-awareness. 95% of the 267 genes we found only in modern humans were not protein-coding, including many long-non-coding RNAs in the self-awareness network. These genes may have arisen by positive selection for the characteristics of human well-being and behavioral modernity, including creativity, prosocial behavior, and healthy longevity. The genes that cluster in association with those found only in modern humans are over-expressed in brain regions involved in human self-awareness and creativity, including late-myelinating and phylogenetically recent regions of neocortex for autobiographical memory in frontal, parietal, and temporal regions, as well as related components of cortico-thalamo-ponto-cerebellar-cortical and cortico-striato-cortical loops. We conclude that modern humans have more than 200 unique non-protein-coding genes regulating co-expression of many more protein-coding genes in coordinated networks that underlie their capacities for self-awareness, creativity, prosocial behavior, and healthy longevity, which are not found in chimpanzees or Neanderthals.;Zwir et al. - 2022 - Evolution of genetic networks for human creativity.txt

An implemented case study is provided incorporating the model into the multi-agent simulation of the Village EcoDynamics Project developed to study the early Pueblo Indian settlers from A.D. 600 to 1300. The dynamic landscape used for settling and farming is abstracted as an artifact and agents learn to adapt its exploitation over time by employing individual, social and population learning strategies. Comparing various strategies revealed learning through social networks while evolving the extent of the network as the best adaptive strategy. The results are consistent with archeological records as a wider margin is observed between social and non-social learners during periods known for the highest landscape variability. In addition, learning through social networks outperforms learning via cultural beliefs which is expected given the heterogeneity of the landscape.;Mokom_2015.txt

When only a few segments of the original piece are available, solutions exclusively based on computational algorithms are inefficient when attempting to create a credible whole restoration. Incomplete 3D puzzles must consequently be tackled by considering hybrid human/computer strategies. This paper presents a reconstruction approach in which the knowledge of human experts and computational solutions coexist together. Hypotheses, models and integration solutions originating from both humans and computers are thus continuously updated until an agreement is reached. This semi-automatic restoration approach has been tested on a set of ancient fractured pieces belonging to the remains of Roman sculptures at the well known Merida site (Spain), and promising results have been obtained. The successful results and applicability of this method have led us to believe that computational solutions should evolve towards hybrid human-computer strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although they constitute an historical patrimony of inestimable value, little efforts have been devoted to the development of automated tools for their classification and interpretation. In this work we present a new algorithm for recognizing petroglyphs within scenes composed of several engraved figures. The proposal combines an unsupervised recognizer, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), with a fuzzy visual language parser. The first classifies the petroglyph symbols extracted from a scene by using Radon transform as shape descriptor. The latter exploits the archeological knowledge about recurring patterns within scenes to solve ambiguous interpretations. The algorithm has been evaluated on a set of 50 petroglyph scenes, containing about 500 carved symbols from Mount Bego rock art site, and achieved very promising results.;ictai.2012.119.txt

PNV is useful for raising public awareness about land degradation and  for estimating land potential. This paper presents results of assessing machine  learning algorithms-neural networks (nnet package), random forest (ranger),  gradient boosting (gbm), K-nearest neighborhood (class) and Cubist-for  operational mapping of PNV. Three case studies were considered: (1) global  distribution of biomes based on the BIOME 6000 data set (8,057 modern  pollen-based site reconstructions), (2) distribution of forest tree taxa in  Europe based on detailed occurrence records (1,546,435 ground observations), and  (3) global monthly fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation  (FAPAR) values (30,301 randomly-sampled points). A stack of 160 global maps  representing biophysical conditions over land, including atmospheric, climatic,  relief, and lithologic variables, were used as explanatory variables. The overall  results indicate that random forest gives the overall best performance. The  highest accuracy for predicting BIOME 6000 classes (20) was estimated to be  between 33% (with spatial cross-validation) and 68% (simple random sub-setting),  with the most important predictors being total annual precipitation, monthly  temperatures, and bioclimatic layers. Predicting forest tree species (73)  resulted in mapping accuracy of 25%, with the most important predictors being  monthly cloud fraction, mean annual and monthly temperatures, and elevation.  Regression models for FAPAR (monthly images) gave an R-square of 90% with the  most important predictors being total annual precipitation, monthly cloud  fraction, CHELSA bioclimatic layers, and month of the year, respectively. Further  developments of PNV mapping could include using all GBIF records to map the  global distribution of plant species at different taxonomic levels. This  methodology could also be extended to dynamic modeling of PNV, so that future  climate scenarios can be incorporated.

XKQSM23Y;journalArticle;2016;"Sefer, Emre; Kingsford, Carl";Diffusion archeology for diffusion progression history reconstruction.;Knowledge and information systems;Diffusion through graphs can be used to model many real-world processes, such as the spread of diseases, social network memes, computer viruses, or water  contaminants. Often, a real-world diffusion cannot be directly observed while it  is occurring - perhaps it is not noticed until some time has passed, continuous  monitoring is too costly, or privacy concerns limit data access. This leads to  the need to reconstruct how the present state of the diffusion came to be from  partial diffusion data. Here, we tackle the problem of reconstructing a diffusion  history from one or more snapshots of the diffusion state. This ability can be  invaluable to learn when certain computer nodes are infected or which people are  the initial disease spreaders to control future diffusions. We formulate this  problem over discrete-time SEIRS-type diffusion models in terms of maximum  likelihood. We design methods that are based on submodularity and a novel  prize-collecting dominating-set vertex cover (PCDSVC) relaxation that can  identify likely diffusion steps with some provable performance guarantees. Our  methods are the first to be able to reconstruct complete diffusion histories  accurately in real and simulated situations. As a special case, they can also  identify the initial spreaders better than the existing methods for that problem.  Our results for both meme and contaminant diffusion show that the partial  diffusion data problem can be overcome with proper modeling and methods, and that  hidden temporal characteristics of diffusion can be predicted from limited data.;Sefer et Kingsford - 2016 - Diffusion archeology for diffusion progression his.txt

To our knowledge, existing studies of sex  determination of the skull mostly utilize supervised learning methods to analyze  and classify data and can have limitations when applied to actual cases with the  absence of category labels in the skull samples or a large difference in the  number of male and female samples of the skull. This paper proposes a novel  approach which is based on an unsupervised classification technique in performing  sex determination of the skull of Han Chinese ethnic group. The 78 landmarks on  the outer surface of 3D skull models from computed tomography scans are marked,  and a skull dataset of a total of 40 interlandmark measurements is constructed. A  stable and efficient unsupervised algorithm which we abbreviated as MKDSIF-FCM is  proposed to address the classification problem for the skull dataset. The  experimental results of the adult skull suggest that the proposed MKDSIF-FCM  algorithm warrants fairly high sex determination accuracy for females and males,  which is 98.0% and 93.02%, respectively, and is superior to all the  classification methods we attempted. As a result of its fairly high accuracy,  extremely good stability, and the advantage of unsupervised learning, the  proposed method is potentially applicable for forensic investigations and  archaeological studies.;Gao et al. - 2018 - Sex Determination of 3D Skull Based on a Novel Uns.txt

While initial attempts to  characterise the major categories used in osseous industry (i.e. bone, antler,  and dentine/ivory) have been successful, the taxonomic determination of  prehistoric artefacts remains to be investigated. The distinction between  reindeer and red deer antler can be challenging, particularly in cases of  anthropic and/or taphonomic modifications. In addition to the range of  destructive physicochemical identification methods available (mass spectrometry,  isotopic ratio, and DNA analysis), X-ray micro-tomography (micro-CT) provides  convincing non-destructive 3D images and analyses. This paper presents the  experimental protocol (sample scans, image processing, and statistical analysis)  we have developed in order to identify modern and archaeological antler  collections (from Isturitz, France). This original method is based on bone  microstructure analysis combined with advanced statistical support vector machine  (SVM) classifiers. A combination of six microarchitecture biomarkers (bone volume  fraction, trabecular number, trabecular separation, trabecular thickness,  trabecular bone pattern factor, and structure model index) were screened using  micro-CT in order to characterise internal alveolar structure. Overall, reindeer  alveoli presented a tighter mesh than red deer alveoli, and statistical analysis  allowed us to distinguish archaeological antler by species with an accuracy of  96%, regardless of anatomical location on the antler. In conclusion, micro-CT  combined with SVM classifiers proves to be a promising additional non-destructive  method for antler identification, suitable for archaeological artefacts whose  degree of human modification and cultural heritage or scientific value has  previously made it impossible (tools, ornaments, etc.).;Lefebvre et al. - 2016 - A Non-Destructive Method for Distinguishing Reinde.txt

METHODS:  Haplogroup U5 mitogenome sequences were gathered from GenBank. The hierarchal  Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (hierBAPS) method was used to generate  groups of sequences that were then projected onto a rooted maximum likelihood  (ML) phylogenetic tree to visualize the pattern of clustering. The haplogroup  statuses of the individual sequences were assessed using Haplogrep2. RESULTS: A  total of 23 hierBAPS groups were identified, all of which corresponded to  subclades defined in Phylotree, v.17. The hierBAPS groups projected onto the ML  phylogeny accurately clustered all haplotypes belonging to a specific haplogroup  in accordance with Haplogrep2. By incorporating the geographic source of each  sequence and subclade age estimates into this framework, inferences about the  diversification of U5 mtDNAs were made. Haplogroup U5 has been present in  northern Europe since the Mesolithic, and spread in both eastern and western  directions, undergoing significant diversification within Scandinavia. A review  of historical and archeological evidence attests to some of the population  interactions contributing to this pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The hierBAPS algorithm  accurately grouped mitogenome sequences into subclades in a phylogenetically  robust manner. This analysis provided new insights into the phylogeographic  structure of haplogroup U5 diversity in northern Europe, revealing a detailed  perspective on the diversity of subclades in this region and their distribution  in Scandinavian populations.;Kristjansson et al. - 2022 - Evolution and dispersal of mitochondrial DNA haplo.txt

Unlike chimpanzees and bonobos, who are known to hunt smaller monkeys and eat them immediately, human foragers often  cooperate to kill large animals and transport them to a safe location to be  shared. While it is known that meat became an important part of the hominin diet  around 2.6-2 Mya, whether intense cooperation and food sharing developed in  conjunction with the regular intake of meat remains unresolved. A widespread  assumption is that early hominins acquired animal protein through  klepto-parasitism at felid kills. This should be testable by detecting  felid-specific bone modifications and tooth marks on carcasses consumed by  hominins. Here, deep learning (DL) computer vision was used to identify agency  through the analysis of tooth pits and scores on bones recovered from the Early  Pleistocene site of DS (Bed I, Olduvai Gorge). We present the first objective  evidence of primary access to meat by hominins 1.8 Mya by showing that the most  common securely detectable bone-modifying fissipeds at the site were hyenas. The  absence of felid modifications in most of the carcasses analyzed indicates that  hominins were the primary consumers of most animals accumulated at the site, with  hyenas intervening at the post-depositional stage. This underscores the role of  hominins as a prominent part of the early Pleistocene African carnivore guild. It  also stresses the major (and potentially regular) role that meat played in the  diet that configured the emergence of early Homo.;Cobo-Sánchez et al. - 2022 - Computer vision supports primary access to meat by.txt

Menez-Dregan I (Brittany, France) is one of the key sites in  Western Europe that dates from this threshold, with an alternating sequence of 16  occupation levels and four marine deposits, from MIS 12 to 8. The large lithic  assemblages of more than 154,000 artifacts from knapping (cores, flakes) and  shaping (macrotools and shaping flakes) show the varying use of raw materials and  activities at the site through the sequence. This work focuses on the study of  the handaxes and cleavers using technological and metrical methods with  multivariate analysis, in combination with geometric morphometrics, and places  these analyses within the context of other technological changes at the site.  Collectively, results show the persistent use through the sequence of the same  lithic raw materials and technologies, including fire use and the import of  glossy sandstone from 20 km away, but with variation in activities at the site.  These findings suggest that Menez-Dregan I shows the development of a specific  material culture that reflects the local resources and environment. Results  further indicate that the site shows the sustained hominin occupation of the  area, despite varying climate and environment, with strong traditions of social  learning that were maintained through flexibility of site use, deep understanding  of the local territory, and the innovation of new technologies, such as the use  of fire.

Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) is one of the major causes of  back pain; no therapeutics are currently available to reverse this disease. The  impact of bone mineral density (BMD) on IVDD has been controversial, with some  studies suggesting osteoporosis as causative for IVDD and others suggesting it as  protective for IVDD. Functional studies to evaluate the influence of genetic  components of BMD in IVDD could highlight opportunities for drug development and  repurposing. By taking a holistic 3D approach, we established an aging zebrafish  model for spontaneous IVDD. Increased BMD in aging, detected by automated  computational analysis, is caused by bone deformities at the endplates. However,  aged zebrafish spines showed changes in bone morphology, microstructure, mineral  heterogeneity, and increased fragility that resembled osteoporosis. Elements of  the discs recapitulated IVDD symptoms found in humans: the intervertebral  ligament (equivalent to the annulus fibrosus) showed disorganized collagen fibers  and herniation, while the disc center (nucleus pulposus equivalent) showed  dehydration and cellular abnormalities. We manipulated BMD in young zebrafish by  mutating sp7 and cathepsin K, leading to low and high BMD, respectively.  Remarkably, we detected IVDD in both groups, demonstrating that low BMD does not  protect against IVDD, and we found a strong correlation between high BMD and  IVDD. Deep learning was applied to high-resolution synchrotron µCT image data to  analyze osteocyte 3D lacunar distribution and morphology, revealing a role of sp7  in controlling the osteocyte lacunar 3D profile.

Thomas P.";The population genomic legacy of the second plague pandemic.;Current biology : CB;Human populations have been shaped by catastrophes that may have left long-lasting signatures in their genomes. One notable example is the second  plague pandemic that entered Europe in ca. 1,347 CE and repeatedly returned for  over 300 years, with typical village and town mortality estimated at 10%-40%.(1)  It is assumed that this high mortality affected the gene pools of these  populations. First, local population crashes reduced genetic diversity. Second, a  change in frequency is expected for sequence variants that may have affected  survival or susceptibility to the etiologic agent (Yersinia pestis).(2) Third,  mass mortality might alter the local gene pools through its impact on subsequent  migration patterns. We explored these factors using the Norwegian city of  Trondheim as a model, by sequencing 54 genomes spanning three time periods: (1)  prior to the plague striking Trondheim in 1,349 CE, (2) the 17(th)-19(th)  century, and (3) the present. We find that the pandemic period shaped the gene  pool by reducing long distance immigration, in particular from the British Isles,  and inducing a bottleneck that reduced genetic diversity. Although we also  observe an excess of large F(ST) values at multiple loci in the genome, these are  shaped by reference biases introduced by mapping our relatively low genome  coverage degraded DNA to the reference genome. This implies that attempts to  detect selection using ancient DNA (aDNA) datasets that vary by read length and  depth of sequencing coverage may be particularly challenging until methods have  been developed to account for the impact of differential reference bias on test  statistics.;Gopalakrishnan et al. - 2022 - The population genomic legacy of the second plague.txt

Due to the significant  difference in soil Cd content and bioavailability among different parent  materials, the previous land classification scheme based on total soil Cd content  as the classification standard, has certain shortcomings. This study aims to  explore the factors influencing soil Cd bioavailability in typical karst areas of  Guilin and to suggest a scientific and effective farmland use management plan  based on the prediction model. A total of 9393 and 8883 topsoil samples were  collected from karst and non-karst areas, respectively. Meanwhile, 149 and 145  rice samples were collected together with rhizosphere soil in karst and non-karst  areas, respectively. The results showed that the higher CaO level in the karst  area was a key factor leading to elevated soil pH value. Although Cd was highly  enriched in karst soils, the higher pH value and adsorption of Mn oxidation  inhibited Cd mobility in soils. Conversely, the Cd content in non-karst soils was  lower, whereas the Cd level in rice grains was higher. To select the optimal  prediction model based on the correlation between Cd bioaccumulation factors and  geochemical parameters of soil, artificial neural network (ANN) and linear  regression prediction models were established in this study. The ANN prediction  model was more accurate than the traditional linear regression model according to  the evaluation parameters of the test set. Furthermore, a new land classification  scheme based on an ANN prediction model and soil Cd concentration is proposed in  this study, making full use of the spatial resources of farmland to ensure safe  rice consumption.;Li_2022_b.txt

As we write, infection rates are at their highest point  globally and are rising extremely rapidly in some areas due to more infectious  variants. The primary target of SARS-CoV-2 is the cellular receptor  angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene  predict that many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to  infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order.  Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while  others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter,  analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences to date indicate large variation  among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades despite low sampling  effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual  strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous  results while finding additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and  suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to  SARS-CoV-2 infection. Troublingly, some species, including the rare and  endangered aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), as well as those in the genera  Avahi and Propithecus, may be at high risk. Given that lemurs are endemic to  Madagascar and among the primates at highest risk of extinction globally, further  understanding of the potential threat of COVID-19 to their health should be a  conservation priority. All feasible actions should be taken to limit their  exposure to SARS-CoV-2.;Melin et al. - 2021 - Variation in predicted COVID-19 risk among lemurs .txt

Alongside  changing patterns of raw material use and decreasing artefact sizes, changes in  artefact types are commonly employed to differentiate Middle Stone Age (MSA) and  Later Stone Age (LSA) assemblages. The current paper employs a quantitative  analytical framework based upon the use of neural networks to examine changing  constellations of technologies between MSA and LSA assemblages from eastern  Africa. Network ensembles were trained to differentiate LSA assemblages from  Marine Isotope Stage 3&4 MSA and Marine Isotope Stage 5 MSA assemblages based  upon the presence or absence of 16 technologies. Simulations were used to extract  significant indicator and contra-indicator technologies for each assemblage  class. The trained network ensembles classified over 94% of assemblages  correctly, and identified 7 key technologies that significantly distinguish  between assemblage classes. These results clarify both temporal changes within  the MSA and differences between MSA and LSA assemblages in eastern Africa.;Grove et Blinkhorn - 2020 - Neural networks differentiate between Middle and L.txt

Given the potential  for currently stabilised dune systems to reactivate under climate change and  increased anthropogenic pressures, identifying the role of external disturbances  in driving geomorphic response is vitally important. We developed a novel  approach, using artificial neural networks (ANNs) applied to time series of  historical reactivation-deposition events from the Nebraska Sandhills, to  determine the relationship between historic periods of sand deposition in  semi-arid grasslands and external climatic conditions, land use pressures and  wildfire occurrence. We show that both vegetation growth and sediment  re-deposition episodes can be accurately estimated. Sensitivity testing of  individual factors shows that localised forcings (overgrazing and wildfire) have  a statistically significant impact when the climate is held at present-day  conditions. However, the dominant effect is climate-induced drought. Our approach  has great potential for estimating future landscape sensitivity to climate and  land use scenarios across a wide range of potentially fragile dryland  environments.;Buckland et al. - 2019 - Using artificial neural networks to predict future.txt

However, it remains unclear to what extent different burial  environments impact these aspects of proteome decay. Teeth have to date been much  less studied than bone but are ideal to explore how proteins decay with time due  to the negligible turnover that occurs in dentine relative to bone. We  investigated the proteome variability and deamidation levels of different  sections of molar teeth from archeological bovine mandibles as well as their  mandibular bone. We obtained a greater yield of proteins from the crown of the  teeth but did not find differences between the different molars analyzed within  each mandible. We also obtained the best variety of protein from a well-preserved  mandible that was not the youngest one in terms of chronological age, showing the  influence of the preservation conditions on the final proteomic outcome.  Intriguingly, we also noticed an increase in abundance levels of fetuin-A in  biologically younger mandibles as reported previously, but the opposite trend in  tooth dentine. Interestingly, we observed higher glutamine deamidation levels in  teeth from the geologically oldest mandible despite it being the biologically  youngest specimen, showing that the archeological age strongly impacts on the  level of deamidations observed, much more so than biological aging. This  indicates that the glutamine deamidation ratio of selected peptides may act as a  good predictor of the relative geochronological age of archeological specimens.;acs.jproteome.7b00648.txt

These methods were designed for populations that lived mostly  in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Their level of reliability or  misclassification is important for practical use in today's forensic practice; it  is, however, unknown. We addressed the question of what the likelihood of errors  would be if population specificity of discriminant functions of the tibia were  disregarded. Moreover, five classification functions in a Czech sample were  proposed (accuracies 82.1-87.5 %, sex bias ranged from -1.3 to -5.4 %). We  measured ten variables traditionally used for sex assessment of the tibia on a  sample of 30 male and 26 female models from recent Czech population. To estimate  the classification accuracy and error (misclassification) rates ignoring  population specificity, we selected published classification functions of tibia  for the Portuguese, south European, and the North American populations. These  functions were applied on the dimensions of the Czech population. Comparing the  classification success of the reference and the tested Czech sample showed that  females from Czech population were significantly overestimated and mostly  misclassified as males. Overall accuracy of sex assessment significantly  decreased (53.6-69.7 %), sex bias -29.4-100 %, which is most probably caused by  secular trend and the generally high variability of body size. Results indicate  that the discriminant functions, developed for skeletal series representing  geographically and chronologically diverse populations, are not applicable in  current forensic investigations. Finally, implications and recommendations for  future research are discussed.";Kotěrová et al. - 2017 - Disregarding population specificity its influence.txt

While traditional water search methods have generally involved  using dive teams, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and water scent dogs for  cases involving submerged objects and bodies, law enforcement is increasingly  integrating multiple methods that include geophysical technologies. There are  numerous advantages for integrating geophysical technologies, such as side scan  sonar and ground penetrating radar (GPR), with more traditional search methods.  Overall, these methods decrease the time involved searching, in addition to  increasing area searched. However, as with other search methods, there are  advantages and disadvantages when using each method. For example, in instances  with excessive aquatic vegetation or irregular bottom terrain, it may not be  possible to discern a submersed body with side scan sonar. As a result, forensic  personnel will have the highest rate of success during searches for submerged  objects when integrating multiple search methods, including deploying multiple  geophysical technologies. The goal of this paper is to discuss the methodology of  various search methods that are employed for submerged objects and how these  various methods can be integrated as part of a comprehensive protocol for water  searches depending upon the type of underwater terrain. In addition, two  successful case studies involving the search and recovery of a submerged human  body using side scan sonar are presented to illustrate the successful application  of integrating a geophysical technology with divers when searching for a  submerged object.;Schultz et al. - 2013 - Detecting submerged objects the application of si.txt

We  offer an alternative approach, informed by methods borrowed from the geographic  information sciences and using recent advances in computer science, to more  efficiently predict where fossil localities might be found. Our model uses an  artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained to recognize the spectral  characteristics of known productive localities and other land cover classes, such  as forest, wetlands, and scrubland, within a study area based on the analysis of  remotely sensed (RS) imagery. Using these spectral signatures, the model then  classifies other pixels throughout the study area. The results of the neural  network classification can be examined and further manipulated within a  geographic information systems (GIS) software package. While we have developed  and tested this model on fossil mammal localities in deposits of Paleocene and  Eocene age in the Great Divide Basin of southwestern Wyoming, a similar  analytical approach can be easily applied to fossil-bearing sedimentary deposits  of any age in any part of the world. We suggest that new analytical tools and  methods of the geographic sciences, including remote sensing and geographic  information systems, are poised to greatly enrich paleoanthropological  investigations, and that these new methods should be embraced by field workers in  the search for, and geospatial analysis of, fossil primates and hominins.;Anemone et al. - 2011 - Finding fossils in new ways an artificial neural .txt

6II83REA;journalArticle;2005;"Manmatha, R.; Rothfeder, Jamie L.";A scale space approach for automatically segmenting words from historical handwritten documents.;IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence;Many libraries, museums, and other organizations contain large collections of handwritten historical documents, for example, the papers of early presidents  like George Washington at the Library of Congress. The first step in providing  recognition/ retrieval tools is to automatically segment handwritten pages into  words. State of the art segmentation techniques like the gap metrics algorithm  have been mostly developed and tested on highly constrained documents like bank  checks and postal addresses. There has been little work on full handwritten pages  and this work has usually involved testing on clean artificial documents created  for the purpose of research. Historical manuscript images, on the other hand,  contain a great deal of noise and are much more challenging. Here, a novel scale  space algorithm for automatically segmenting handwritten (historical) documents  into words is described. First, the page is cleaned to remove margins. This is  followed by a gray-level projection profile algorithm for finding lines in  images. Each line image is then filtered with an anisotropic Laplacian at several  scales. This procedure produces blobs which correspond to portions of characters  at small scales and to words at larger scales. Crucial to the algorithm is scale  selection, that is, finding the optimum scale at which blobs correspond to words.  This is done by finding the maximum over scale of the extent or area of the  blobs. This scale maximum is estimated using three different approaches. The  blobs recovered at the optimum scale are then bounded with a rectangular box to  recover the words. A postprocessing filtering step is performed to eliminate  boxes of unusual size which are unlikely to correspond to words. The approach is  tested on a number of different data sets and it is shown that, on 100 sampled  documents from the George Washington corpus of handwritten document images, a  total error rate of 17 percent is observed. The technique outperforms a  state-of-the-art gap metrics word-segmentation algorithm on this collection.;Manmatha et Rothfeder - 2005 - A scale space approach for automatically segmentin.txt

This analysis is applied to the 1650 B.C. wall  paintings from the prehistoric settlement on Thera, and inferences of great  archaeological and historical importance are made. In particular, strong evidence  is obtained suggesting that the spirals depicted on the wall paintings correspond  to linear (Archimedes) spirals, certain shapes correspond to canonical 48-gon and  32-gon, while other shapes correspond to parts of ellipses. It seems that the  presented wall paintings constitute the earliest archaeological findings on which  these geometrical patterns appear with such remarkable accuracy.;TIP.2005.849297.txt

Availability of electronic imaging tools and  effective image processing techniques makes it feasible to process the multimedia  data in large databases. In this paper, a framework for content-based retrieval  of historical documents in the Ottoman Empire archives is presented. The  documents are stored as textual images, which are compressed by constructing a  library of symbols occurring in a document, and the symbols in the original image  are then replaced with pointers into the codebook to obtain a compressed  representation of the image. The features in wavelet and spatial domain based on  angular and distance span of shapes are used to extract the symbols. In order to  make content-based retrieval in historical archives, a query is specified as a  rectangular region in an input image and the same symbol-extraction process is  applied to the query region. The queries are processed on the codebook of  documents and the query images are identified in the resulting documents using  the pointers in textual images.

The exploitation of remote sensing data and their products have seen an increased use in recent years in the fields of archaeological science and cultural heritage. Different spatial and spectral analysis datasets have been applied to distinguish archaeological remains and detect changes in the landscape over time, and, in the last decade, archaeologists have adopted more thoroughly automated object detection approaches for potential sites. These approaches included, among others, object detection methods, such as those of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, as well as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep learning (DL) models using aerial and satellite images, airborne and spaceborne remote sensing (ASRS), multispectral, hyperspectral images, and active methods (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging radar (LiDAR)). Researchers also refer to the potential for archaeologists to explore such artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in various ways, such as identifying archaeological features and classifying them. Here, we present a review study related to the contributions of remote sensing (RS) and artificial intelligence in archaeology. However, a main question remains open in the field of research: the rate of positive contribution of remote sensing and artificial intelligence techniques in archaeological research.

NWV6ZXQ4;conferencePaper;2010;"Zhang, ZQ; Chapman, S; Ciravegna, F";A Methodology towards Effective and Efficient Manual Document Annotation: Addressing Annotator Discrepancy and Annotation Quality;;"Manual document annotation is an essential technique for knowledge acquisition and capture. Creating high-quality annotations is a difficult task due to inter-annotator discrepancy, the problem that annotators can never agree completely on what and exactly how to annotate. To address this, traditional document annotation involves multiple domain experts working on the same annotation task in an iterative and collaborative manner to identify and resolve discrepancies progressively. However, such a detailed process is often ineffective despite taking significant time and effort; unfortunately, discrepancies remain high in many cases. This paper proposes an alternative approach to document annotation. The approach tackles the problem by firstly studying annotators' suitability based on the types of information to be annotated; then identifying and isolating the most inconsistent annotators who tend to cause the majority of discrepancies in a task; finally distributing annotation workload among the most suitable annotators. Tested in a named entity annotation task in the domain of archaeology, we show that compared to the traditional approach to document annotation, it produces larger amounts of better quality annotations that result in higher machine learning accuracy while requires significantly less time and effort.";Zhang et al. - 2010 - A Methodology towards Effective and Efficient Manu.txt
XZVC9NDX;journalArticle;2022;Pankowská, A;A taphonomic approach to Corded Ware culture mortuary practices in Moravia;ARCHEOLOGICKE ROZHLEDY;The reconstruction of the grave environment is a key element in the interpretation of the burial rite. The methods of field anthropology and histotaphonomy can be useful in gaining a better understanding of the micro-environment in which the dead body decomposed. Based on the example of five graves from the period of the Corded Ware culture, the study aims to determine the conditions in which the bodies of the deceased were found, or how they were postmortem treated. The skeletal remains of four individuals bore traces of deposition in a hollow space. A histological analysis revealed that the decomposition of soft tissues in these individuals must either have been arrested or, in contrast, highly accelerated, since the bone microstructure was not damaged by microorganisms. The decomposition of the bodies could have been accelerated in an open space such as a partially sunken grave with a construction. Alternatively, decomposition could have occurred as the result of higher temperatures in the form of heat or smoke, but also due to a repeatedly water-logged environment. Specific traces exist on skeletal remains for all of these possibilities. A complex taphonomic analysis of the skeletal remains brings new and more detailed information about the circumstances of the burial, significantly expanding the possibilities of interpreting the concept of death in the past.;Pankowská - 2022 - A taphonomic approach to Corded Ware culture mortu.txt

Its restoration had been in the hands of a multidisciplinary team of experts and it had undergone a series of complex procedures. To this end, computational approaches that can support in deciding the most visually appropriate inpainting for very degraded historical items would be helpful as a second objective opinion for the restorers. The present paper thus attempts to put forward a U-Net approach with a perceptual loss for the semantic inpainting of traditional Romanian vests. Images taken of pieces from the collection of the Oltenia Museum in Craiova, along with such images with garments from the Internet, have been given to the deep learning model. The resulting numerical error for inpainting the corrupted parts is adequately low, however the visual similarity still has to be improved by considering further possibilities for finer tuning.;Stoean et al. - 2022 - On Using Perceptual Loss within the U-Net Architec.txt
AFK3AY67;journalArticle;2022;Goknar, M;Naval images, ideas and notes by Leonardo da Vinci;ARCHAEOLOGIA MARITIMA MEDITERRANEA-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGY;"Recent research makes it possible to study more precisely what Leonardo da Vinci drew and noted on naval subjects; thus, we can update and complete the proposals produced from 1939 to 1954, mainly by the naval engineer Luigi Tursini. Leonardo's notes, pictures, and drawings related to naval subjects are scattered and incomplete, but we can still identify some trends, which Leonardo followed fairly consistently, as in research programs. Leonardo had a deep self-taught culture; in the nautical field he knew the main classical sources and the Navis (now lost) by Leon Battista Alberti. He was also familiar with the naval machines and weapons proposed by his forerunners, but he developed his knowledge mainly through experiences, which he obtained through observations, interviews and tests. His observations on vessels were complementary to his research on the motions of water and air. He learned how to sail with a lateen sail, moreover he studied the shape of hulls and their resistance to water in relation to the growth of eddies and tacking of a sailboat in comparison to the flight of birds. He developed basic ideas on the best shapes of hulls even with a test tank, anticipating studies begun in the 18th and 19th centuries. Leonardo accurately recorded sea and river crafts of the Tyrrhenian coast, the Milanese shipping canals, the Adda, the Ticino, and Lake Maggiore. His drawings confirm that local Lombard crafts were generally similar to the traditional ones used until the early decades of the 20th century. Leonardo distinguished well the types of hulls, rudders, and rigging, and also made some notes on construction details, but he did not develop these elements; he drew construction details and general plans only for other projects and subjects, but for water crafts he drew only first-hand ideas, sketches that he perhaps planned to develop later. He could have jotted down other naval subjects, but most likely many of his notes were lost. He knew of a boat designed by Filippo Brunelleschi to carry marble and other heavy loads to Florence, but we do not know what it looked like, although some sketches circulated among scholars. Certainly, Leonardo saw and probably noted the parade boats used by the court of Ludovico il Moro around 1490. They were similar to the bucintoro built in 1475 by Luca Fancelli for the Duke of Mantua, a reconstruction of which is proposed here. This article reports the first part of the study; the forthcoming second part will deal of naval machines, common and special warships, underwater solutions and naval weapons.";NA

The presence of trees and undergrowth makes the reconnaissance of archaeological features and remains very difficult, while the erosion, increased by slope, tends to adversely affect the microtopographical features of potential archaeological interest, thus making them hardly identifiable. For the purpose of our investigations, a UAV LiDAR survey has been carried out at Perticara (located in Basilicata southern Italy), an abandoned medieval village located in a geologically fragile area, characterized by complex topography, strong erosion, and a dense forest cover. All of these characteristics pose serious challenge issues and make this site particularly significant and attractive for the setting and testing of an optimal LiDAR-based approach to analyze hilly forested regions searching for subtle archaeological features. The LiDAR based investigations were based on three steps: (i) field data acquisition and data pre-processing, (ii) data post-processing, and (iii) semi-automatic feature extraction method based on machine learning and local statistics. The results obtained from the LiDAR based analyses successfully confirmed by the field survey) made it possible to identify the lost medieval village that represents an emblematic case of settlement abandoned during the crisis of the late Middle Ages that affected most regions in southern Italy.;Masini et al. - 2022 - UAV LiDAR Based Approach for the Detection and Int.txt

Telluric artifacts, imperfect line lists, inexact continuum placement, and inflexible models frustrate the scientific promise of these information-rich data sets. Here we debut an interpretable machine-learning framework blase that addresses these and other challenges. The semiempirical approach can be viewed as \transfer learning\""-first pretraining models on noise-free precomputed synthetic spectral models, then learning the corrections to line depths and widths from whole-spectrum fitting to an observed spectrum. The auto-differentiable model employs back-propagation, the fundamental algorithm empowering modern deep learning and neural networks. Here, however, the 40,000+ parameters symbolize physically interpretable line profile properties such as amplitude, width, location, and shape, plus radial velocity and rotational broadening. This hybrid data-/model-driven framework allows joint modeling of stellar and telluric lines simultaneously, a potentially transformative step forward for mitigating the deleterious telluric contamination in the near-infrared. The blase approach acts as both a deconvolution tool and semiempirical model. The general-purpose scaffolding may be extensible to many scientific applications, including precision radial velocities, Doppler imaging, chemical abundances for Galactic archeology, line veiling, magnetic fields, and remote sensing. Its sparse-matrix architecture and GPU acceleration make blase fast. The open-source PyTorch-based code blase includes tutorials, Application Programming Interface documentation, and more.

The research is based on the Joconde database maintained by the French Ministry of Culture that contains illustrated artwork records from main French public and private museums representing archeological objects, decorative arts, fine arts, historical and scientific documents, etc. The Joconde database includes semantic metadata that describes properties of the artworks and their content. The developed methods create a data pipeline that processes metadata, trains a Convolutional Neural Network image classification model, makes prediction for the entire collection and expands the metadata to be the base for the SPARQL search queries. We developed a set of such queries to identify noise and silence in the human annotations and to search image content with results ranked according to the relevance of the objects quantified by the prediction score provided by the deep learning model. We also developed methods to discover new contextual relationships between the concepts in the metadata by analyzing the contrast between the concepts' similarities in the Joconde's semantic model and other vocabularies and we tried to improve the model prediction scores based on the semantic relations. Our results show that cross-fertilization between symbolic AI and machine learning can indeed provide the tools to address the challenges of the museum curators work describing the artwork pieces and searching for the relevant images.;Bobasheva et al. - 2022 - Learning and Reasoning for Cultural Metadata Quali.txt

The information database of archaeological sites of South- Eastern Altai was created based on literary sources, the authors' own field research. Schemes of distribution of archaeological sites according to some landscape features: absolute height; position in relation to watercourses; slopes; exposition; solar radiation intensity in June; Intensities of solar radiation for December was created on the basis of geoinformation analysis of the relief of the territory and the available archaeological data. The obtained statistical regularities of the distribution of archaeological sites in the landscapes of South-Eastern Altai were the basis for the creation and verification of the algorithm of a machine-learning model - a neural network. Based on the results, a forecast map of the location of archaeological sites was created. The greatest probability of discovering new archaeological objects could be provided by the following landscape parameters, no further than 500-600 m from the river with a slope steepness of up to 4 degrees, with high intensity and summer ( June) solar radiation and with an exposure of slopes: southern, south-eastern and western. Unexplored archaeological sites in South-East Altai are most likely located along river valleys in the middle and lower reaches, at the confluence of rivers, along the periphery of intermountain basins, or on wide flat areas of above-floodplain terraces of river valleys.

This identification, based on phytolith wave pattern, is made using a pretrained VGG19 deep learning model. This approach has been tested in three key phytolith genera for the study of agricultural origins in Near East archaeology: Avena, Hordeum and Triticum. Also, this classification has been validated at species-level using Triticum boeoticum and dicoccoides images. Due to the diversity of microscopes, cameras and chemical treatments that can influence images of phytolith slides, three types of data augmentation techniques have been implemented: rotation of the images at 45-degree angles, random colour and brightness jittering, and random blur/sharpen. The implemented workflow has resulted in an overall accuracy of 93.68% for phytolith genera, improving previous attempts. The algorithm has also demonstrated its potential to automatize the classification of phytoliths species with an overall accuracy of 100%.

Valuable physical and chemical information can be obtained through scientific micro damage analysis of precious pottery, which plays a positive role in the protection of ceramics and archaeological research. In this study, LIBS spectroscopy combined with sequential backward selection-random forest regression (SBS-RFR) algorithm was proposed for simultaneous quantitative analysis of multi-elements in ceramic samples. Firstly, the experimental conditions for LIBS spectrum acquisition of ceramic samples were optimized, including delay time, laser pulse energy and cumulative times, and the characteristic emission lines of typical elements in LIBS spectra of ceramic samples were identified based on national institute of standards and technology (NIST) database. Four different spectral preprocessing methods are used to preprocess LIBS spectral data to find a better preprocessing method. And then, SBS algorithm is applied to eliminate irrelevant or redundant feature variables of LIBS spectrum. SBS-RFR calibration model is constructed based on the screened input variables to realize the rapid determination of multi-element content of ceramic samples. To further verify the prediction performance of the SBS-RFR calibration model, its prediction performance is compared with several other models. The results show that SBS-RFR model has better prediction performance than partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest regression (RFR), of which the R-2 values of prediction set are all over or close 0.98, and the RMSE values for Mg, Al, Ca and Fe are 0.3954%, 0.4627%, 0.2532% and 0.3791% respectively.

A case study from central Italy;JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE;The need for a quantitative approach to the morphologic study of ceramics is becoming increasingly evident. Ceramics are the most common material in many archaeological sites and a huge amount of data has accumulated over time. This data can be handled by Machine Learning algorithms which are rapidly gaining popularity in archaeology. Although most approaches can be referred to classification tasks, in this contribution a particular type of Neural Network is proposed for feature extraction from archaeological ceramics. Through this proposed method it is possible to gain a numerical weighted representation of the pottery profile that can be used for multivariate analyses. The case study will focus on regionalisation processes in pottery production between the end of the 2nd millennium BC and the first half of the 1st millennium BC in central Tyrrhenian Italy, a period that saw major transformations in the cultural and socio-political structure of Ancient Italy. The results seem to confirm the regionalisation hypothesis and offer interesting insights into the quantitative study of archaeological ceramics.;Cardarelli - 2022 - A deep variational convolutional Autoencoder for u.txt

Understanding the firing regimes of archaeological ceramics reveals clues about the history of technological developments, but current methods for determining firing history have limitations. We experimented with non-destructive micro-CT combined with 3D image analysis to collect data on 42 pore variables, hypothesizing that pore systems are affected by ceramic firing temperatures. Analysis of variance showed that 26 of the variables are significantly related to firing temperature. Total volume porosity (open and closed pores) goes down with increased firing temperature, as does the fraction of pores accessible to a surface. Maximum pore volume, maximum and standard deviation of pore surface area, and pore elongation measures all decrease with higher firing temperatures while shape factors indicating greater sphericity increase. Pore connectivity measures decrease with higher firing temperatures, and variation in pore and connection lengths increases. The highest fired ceramics have low connection tortuosity. Three-dimensional image analysis of micro-CT data can augment existing methods of archaeothermometry, and since many pore characteristics impact the functional properties of ceramics (density, durability, mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, permeability, and diffusion), firing temperature studies of pore systems can inform wider archaeological ceramics research.;Reedy et Reedy - 2022 - Micro-Computed Tomography with 3D Image Analysis t.txt

Their peculiarities are due to their roles as both a technological objective and in the management of core convexities to retain its geometric properties during reduction. In Middle Paleolithic con-texts, these backed implements are commonly produced during Levallois and discoidal reduction sequences. Backed products from Levallois and discoidal reduction sequences often show common geometric and morphological features that complicate their attribution to one of these methods. This study examines the identification of experimentally produced discoidal and recurrent centripetal Levallois backed products (including all stages of reduction) based on their morphological features. 3D geometric morphometrics are employed to quantify morphological variability among the experimental sample. Dimensionality reduction though principal component analysis is combined with 11 machine learning models for the identification of knapping methods. A supported vector machine with polynomial kernel has been identified as the best model (with a general accuracy of 0.76 and an area under the curve [AUC] of 0.8).

In a project applying ML to Scandinavian rock art data, it was noticed that the algorithm struggles with classifying certain motifs correctly.

It is argued that it is necessary to bring machines and humans into a meaningful dialogue attempting to understand why apparent \misclassifications \"" happen.

Predicting original flake mass allows for researchers to make estimations of remaining mass, lost mass, and other features. All these measures relate to the organization of lithic technology by past societies. The present work tests three different models to predict log of flake mass: multiple linear regression, random forest regression, and artificial neural networks (ANN). Estimations of flake mass were performed using the remaining features of flakes from an experimental assemblage. This assemblage was obtained by the expansion of a previous dataset through the inclusion of bigger flakes, allowing the analysis to account for the effects of sample size and value distribution. Correlation results show a large/strong relation between predictions and real outcome (r(2) = 0.78 in the best case). Comparison of the models affords insights into variable importance for predicting flake mass. Results show that (for the present dataset) multiple linear regression still stands as the best method for predicting log of flake weight. Additionally, transformation of predicted values from the multiple linear regression and true values to the linear scale reinforces the linear correlation above the 0.8 threshold.;Bustos-Pérez et Preysler - 2022 - Multiple approaches to predicting flake mass.txt

However, manual labelling on low-quality monochromatic historical orthophotos for semantic segmentation (pixel-level classification) is particularly challenging and time consuming. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology for the automated extraction of very-high-resolution (VHR) multi-class LC maps from historical orthophotos under the absence of target-specific ground truth annotations. The methodology builds on recent evolutions in deep learning, leveraging domain adaptation and transfer learning. First, an unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation between a source domain (recent RGB image of high quality, annotations available) and the target domain (historical monochromatic image of low quality, no annotations available) is learned using a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN). Second, a state-of-the-art fully convolutional network (FCN) for semantic segmentation is pre-trained on a large annotated RGB earth observation (EO) dataset that is converted to the target domain using the I2I function. Third, the FCN is fine-tuned using self-annotated data on a recent RGB orthophoto of the study area under consideration, after conversion using again the I2I function. The methodology is tested on a new custom dataset: the 'Sagalassos historical land cover dataset', which consists of three historical monochromatic orthophotos (1971, 1981, 1992) and one recent RGB orthophoto (2015) of VHR (0.3-0.84 m GSD) all capturing the same greater area around Sagalassos archaeological site (Turkey), and corresponding manually created annotations (2.7 km(2) per orthophoto) distinguishing 14 different LC classes. Furthermore, a comprehensive overview of open-source annotated EO datasets for multiclass semantic segmentation is provided, based on which an appropriate pretraining dataset can be selected. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is effective, increasing the mean intersection over union by 27.2% when using domain adaptation, and by 13.0% when using domain pretraining, and that transferring weights from a model pretrained on a dataset closer to the target domain is preferred.;van den Broeck et al. - 2022 - Multiclass Land Cover Mapping from Historical Orth.txt

Additionally, the completion of their shape and volume is sometimes costly and occasionally requires a lot of manual work, in particular for exhibition purposes. As a first step, improving the geometry of the fragments could potentially help the archaeological conservators in the assembling process. In this direction, in this paper we propose an end-to-end hybrid approach (i.e. point clouds to benefit from the limited complexity and creating results in mesh benefiting from their visualization capabilities) for the digital auto-completion of fragmented archaeological artifacts with missing parts in combination with a novel self-supervised data augmentation scheme in order to address a significant limitation in the archaeological domain (i.e. limited available observations and absence of the complete object). Our approach uses only 5 fragments of a partly preserved archaeological object for training. As a first step, an object (i.e artifact fragment) in mesh representation is converted to point cloud, from which more fragments of the incomplete original object are artificially generated, with the help of 3D surfaces, to augment the dataset. This dataset is then passed in a GAN-based Cascaded refinement network for generating a complete output, which is, finally, converted back to a mesh. Our experiments showed that the proposed hybrid approach, can be successfully used to complete and restore the geometry of a partly preserved archaeological object without having ever seen the complete form of it. However, due to the complexity of the fragments, such methods in most cases cannot generate their fine decorative and surface details. (c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

From the very beginning of photography, during the first half of 19th century, people were amazed by this new media that could record all aspects of a scene with great detail. Soon though, everybody started wondering why would such an impressive innovation fail to record colors? A process of trials and errors then started (induding the most successful and pioneer one, involving the use of potato starch, by Lu-miere brothers) aiming to add colors to photographs, till the consolidation of new systems (camera and film) capable to collect photographs directly in color. In the past, before and during this innovative approach, native black and white photographs were painted in the effort to give them life. Today, only few methods are available to convert a panchromatic image into a color one, and they need a number of steps and further development to work properly. The paper tries to present different methods to colorize native black and white photographs, based on available automatic or interactive Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning or Deep Learning) algorithms, on revised remote sensing procedures and on visual tricks, aiming at exploring the possible improvement in readability and interpreta-tion of photographed contests in the usual analytic process of photo-interpretation. At the same time, colorized historical photographs hold different appeal in the general public and have the potential to attract and involve non-experts in the archaeological/historical reconstruction phases.;Cantoro - 2022 - POTATOES, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND OTHER AMENIT.txt

During the archeological excavations, 14 inhumation pits with the human remains of 21 individuals were found at the site. The subsequent identification process was carried out, including the analysis and cross-comparison of post-mortem data obtained in situ and in the lab with ante-mortem data obtained from historical archives. In parallel, three anthropologists with diverse backgrounds in craniofacial identification and two students without previous experience attempted to identify 11 of these 21 individuals using the craniofacial superimposition technique. To do this, the five participants had access to 18 3D scanned skulls and 14 photographs of 11 different candidates. The participants faced a cross-comparison problem involving 252 skull-face overlay scenarios. The methodology follows the main agreements of the European project MEPROCS and uses the software Skeleton-ID (TM). Based on MEPROCS standard, a final decision was provided within a scale, assigning a value in terms of strong, moderate, or limited support to the claim that the skull and the facial image belonged (or not) to the same person for each case. The problem of binary classification, positive/negative, with an identification rate for each participant was revealed. The results obtained in this study make the authors think that both the quality of the materials used and the previous experience of the analyst play a fundamental role when reaching conclusions using the CFS technique.""";Martos et al. - 2022 - Computer-aided craniofacial superimposition valida.txt

The workshop's plenary lectures were on: i)  viral pandemics and epidemics in the ancient Mediterranean; ii) the impact of  obesity on the outcome of viral infections in children and adolescents; and iii)  COVID-19 and artificial intelligence. Despite the scarcity of evidence from  fossils and remnants, viruses have been recognised as significant causes of  several epidemics in the ancient Mediterranean. Paediatric obesity, a modifiable  critical health risk factor, has been shown to impact on the development,  progression and severity of viral infections. Thus, the prevention of paediatric  obesity should be included in formulating public health policies and  decision-making strategies against emerging global viral threats. During the  current COVID-19 pandemic, artificial intelligence has been used to facilitate  the identification, monitoring and prevention of SARS-CoV-2. In the future, it  will play a fundamental role in the surveillance of epidemic-prone infectious  diseases, in the repurposing of older therapies and in the design of novel  therapeutic agents against viral infections. The collaboration between different  medical specialties and other diverse scientific fields, including archaeology,  history, epidemiology, nutritional technologies, mathematics, computer  technology, engineering, medical law and ethics is essential for the successful  management of paediatric viral infections. The current COVID-19 pandemic has  underscored this need, which should be further encouraged in modern medical  education.";Mammas et al. - 2022 - Insights in paediatric virology during the COVID-1.txt

Machine learning models have been effective in identifying conditions ideal for preservation, exposure, and discovery of fossils in a range of geographic contexts. Researchers working in the Koobi Fora Formation of northern Kenya have long inquired about the geographic patterning of extinct fauna and their respective paleoenvironments. This project is the first attempt to use machine learning techniques to capture paleoecological patterns utilizing topographical and spectral variables that may be predictive of the input of aquatic components in the paleoenvironments of the Koobi Fora Formation.;Dorans_2020.txt
